You will apply your knowledge and professional engineering skills to diverse applications such as fixed and rotary wing aircraft, spacecraft and space missions, and renewable energy.\nThe first two years of the course are devoted to core concepts, which are taught via lectures, supported by practical experience through coursework, and computer and physical lab activities. In addition to core theoretical knowledge, you will develop wider skills, such as teamwork and presentation skills, as part of our design-build-test project.\nThe third-year research project will allow you to apply your technical knowledge to tackle an open-ended problem; for example, the automated landing of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV), the design of a potential space mission, or experimental testing of advanced composite materials. You will be working closely with academics who are world-leading specialists in their research areas, and make use of our extensive facilities.\nIn your final year, you will complete an industry-focused design project, working in groups to undertake the design of a whole aerospace vehicle and replicate processes commonly used in industry. You could be tasked with designing a hydrogen-powered civil aircraft, a future uncrewed aerial vehicle, or even an interplanetary science mission. You will also choose from optional units, allowing you to specialise in the areas that align with your interests and career plans.\nThe city of Bristol is at the heart of aerospace engineering in the UK, and our\nIndustrial Liaison Office\norganises company engagement through all years of the course, making the most of nearby aerospace companies.\nThe diversity of topics in aerospace engineering makes this a challenging degree, but the reward is a uniquely broad education which equips you for an exciting career in solving the problems of the future.\nThis course is currently undergoing its scheduled five-year re-accreditation process with the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS). It has previously been accredited by RAeS.

These are skills highly prized by employers, so our students go on to succeed in a variety of fields, including teaching, technology, finance and broadcasting.\nWith our broad range of subjects and types of assessment, you will have the opportunity to use your creativity, follow your ideas and research independently, and build innovative team projects.\nWhether you are completely new to the subject or you have been inspired by previous studies, you will discover new ways of exploring the ancient Mediterranean. Studying Ancient History at Bristol will expand your knowledge of Greco-Roman societies while enriching your understanding of the challenges facing us today.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nABB\nA-level contextual offer:\nBBC\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a328,200 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nYou will develop the core knowledge and critical thinking skills of an Ancient Historian by combining mandatory units with optional ones. Our first-year units are specifically designed to introduce you to studying Ancient History at university level, no matter your previous experience of the subject. You will explore a huge range of source materials throughout your degree, including art, literature and archaeology. There is no requirement to read Latin or Greek, however, you will have the chance to study these languages, too. You will also have the option to take other units from elsewhere in the Arts faculty or beyond.\nIn your second year, you will take units which help you to think more deeply about the malleability of history - where are the borders of the ancient Mediterranean?

They will be team players with a breadth of skills and qualities that enable them to work across specialisms and cultures.\nThis course combines in-depth subject specialism at the University of Bristol alongside interdisciplinary, practice-based learning. In conjunction with your anthropology studies, you will apply your subject knowledge by translating ideas into innovative solutions, which may include plans for digital and creative enterprises, both social and commercial.\nThe course will teach you the fundamentals of anthropology in its broadest sense, studying humanity in all its diversity and covering the fundamental theories, methodologies and empirical bases of this interdisciplinary subject. You will recognise that human diversity holds multiple problems as well as creative solutions.\nGroup work is a core component of teaching and learning in innovation. You will come together with students from other innovation disciplines, such as electrical and electronic engineering, psychology and business and management. Each subject contributes a different perspective on a challenge as you identify needs and develop ideas. By drawing on your unique ideas and views of the world, you will learn from your subject and other students to develop innovative solutions together. You will also develop personal skills with opportunities for individual development and pursuit of topics and projects driven by your own interests and values.\nBy the time you graduate, you will have a portfolio of work ranging from live client projects to planning your entrepreneurial venture. You will have learned how to evaluate the potential of products and services, and how to sustain new endeavours including through financing. Importantly, you will have cultivated a network of peers and advisers who have worked with you through your studies.\nFor more information visit the\nCentre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n.\nThe Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship will be located in the University\u2019s new Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026, where your Innovation units will be taught.

Are you keen to explore literatures and cultures in an unbordered way, so that national boundaries, disciplinary divisions and linguistic know-how are no barrier to where your curiosity and intellectual ambition might lead?\nOur BA Comparative Literatures and Cultures and Modern Languages degree offers an unmatched opportunity to study international cultural production in both depth and breadth, while also studying French, German, Italian, Portuguese (beginners only), Russian or Spanish.\nComparative Literatures and Cultures takes you on a journey across and between cultures that will sharpen your analytical skills and equip you with a cultural agility fit for our globalized world. The programme challenges ideas of capital-L Literature or of \u2018the canon\u2019 and knocks down false boundaries between \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 culture by exploring the diversity of literary and cultural production both across the globe and across the centuries. Through both core and optional units, our comparatists examine the long and fascinating history of interactions between literary works and other forms (portraiture, book illustration, film), media (video, digital literature) and disciplines (visual arts, philosophy, history, social sciences).\nOn the language side of your degree, you will follow a structured language course in your chosen language. You will also take a range of core and optional units that focus on topics such as the literature, history, cinema, religion, politics and visual art of culture(s) where your chosen language is spoken. Your third year is spent abroad, extending your language skills and cultural knowledge. To find out more, visit the\nCentre for Study Abroad\n.\nBristol's multilingualism and cultural diversity make it the ideal location for this degree. The city offers countless opportunities for you to take your cultural analyses from the seminar into the \u2018real world\u2019, be this through encounters with Banksy\u2019s street art, with murals honouring the Bristol Bus Boycott's fight for racial equality or through work on how Bristol\u2019s institutions have responded to decolonization.\nThe degree fosters qualities valued by employers: intercultural understanding, analytical and critical thinking, self-confidence and daring in communication, an aptitude for collaborative work, and creativity. It will instil habits of curiosity, openness, rigour, self-reflection, and evidence-based thinking, which will prepare you for a flexible career across a wide range of sectors.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nABB\nA-level contextual offer:\nBBC\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n4  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nQR21\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\n,\nPlacements\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a328,200 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nYour degree will be made up of a combination of core and optional units.\nOn the Comparative Literatures and Cultures side, core units will introduce you to the practices and debates of comparative literature and the study of visual cultures (e.g., photography, street art and film). These show how insights and methods from postcolonialism and decolonization, translation studies, multiculturalism, and multilingualism can throw new light on the comparative study of literatures and cultures. In the final year, you will do an independent research project. In all years, you will also be able to choose optional units based on the culture of a single language or a combination of cultures, or from other departments in Arts (for example, Classics, Art History, English or Theology).\nOn the language side of your degree, you will do core language units each year in your chosen language of study (reading, writing, listening, grammar and speaking). Alongside these, you will take a range of core and optional units relating to the culture/cultures in which your language is spoken. These will focus on topics such as literature, history, film, politics, linguistics or visual art. You choose your language after you accept an offer.\nThe cutting-edge research interests and methods of our dedicated and dynamic staff inform our teaching, which takes place through lectures, seminars, workshops, and one-to-one project supervision.

The programme challenges narrow ideas of capital-L Literature or of \u2018the canon' and knocks down false boundaries between \u2018high' and \u2018low' culture by exploring the diversity of literary and cultural production across the globe \u2013 from Italy to Russia, Morocco to China, Brazil to Senegal \u2013 and across the centuries. Through both core and optional units, our comparatists examine the long and fascinating history of interactions between literary works and other forms (portraiture, book illustration, film), media (video, digital literature) and disciplines (visual arts, philosophy, history, social sciences).\nThis degree considers the many ways in which Literatures and Cultures move through time and space, such as through individual forms of contact (reader reception, influence, and intertextuality), sociopolitics (trade, migration, colonization) and technologies that have shaped literary and visual culture.\nAll texts are studied in English through the tool of the curious comparatist: translation. You will benefit from the Translation Studies expertise in the School of Modern Languages as you discover the varieties and varied roles of translation\ns\nin the movement, adaptation, and appropriation of texts.\nBristol's multilingualism and cultural diversity make it the ideal location for this degree.

These units also show how insights and methods drawn from postcolonialism and decolonization, translation studies, multiculturalism, and multilingualism can throw new light on the comparative study of Literatures and Cultures.\nAll year three students do an independent research project. You will produce an extended essay on a comparative topic of your choice and supplement it with a knowledge-dissemination project that allows you to think creatively about how to communicate your research to non-specialists. You might, for example, create a radio programme pitch or an exhibition catalogue.\nIn all years, you will choose optional units based on the culture of a single language or a combination of cultures, or from other departments in Arts (e.g. Classics, Art History, English or Theology).

You will also be able to explore your own interests by choosing from a range of stimulating optional and research-led subjects.\nThe curriculum is designed to enable you to benefit from the research expertise of members of staff from both disciplines.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAA\nA-level contextual offer:\nABB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a328,200 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nIn your first year in philosophy, you will gain a grounding in the fundamentals of philosophy through two mandatory introductory units; one exploring issues in epistemology and metaphysics; the other concerning moral and political philosophy. You will also take a unit in critical thinking and logic.\nIn year two, you complete your foundation in philosophy with mandatory units and conduct more detailed studies from ethics to philosophy of language.\nThe third-year units require engagement with the latest research. Students reach a high level of attainment and are well prepared for postgraduate study, both in philosophy and many other subjects.\nIn your first year in English, you will take two units that are designed to help you make the transition to university-level study, alongside a survey unit that will introduce you to literature from a particular historical era. In your second year, you will have the opportunity to take additional survey units, as well as exploration units - which offer a deeper dive into the literature of particular historical periods - and specialist subjects, which are research-led units.\nThe English and Philosophy degree will equip you with a wide range of transferable skills, including textual analysis, clear written and verbal expression and critical thinking, which are valuable in a wide range of careers.\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

A knowledge of a language will allow you direct access to the cultural production, political debates and economic data from the culture(s) in which it is spoken.\nAll modern languages students have access to our state-of-the-art Multimedia Centre.

Alongside this, you will follow a structured language course in your chosen language and gain a grounding in key historical and cultural aspects of communities in which it is spoken.

At the same time, you will continue your language study and take a combination of core and optional units that extend your understanding of the cultures in which your language is spoken. Units may include history, literature, politics, linguistics, film and visual art.\nIn your final year, you will also undertake an individual research project in which you combine your linguistic, cultural and management competencies by exploring a case study of interest to you, leading to the development of a business plan.\nYear three is spent abroad in a country where your language is spoken, refining your language skills and cultural knowledge and gaining valuable work experience.

These are complemented by weekly concerts, regular masterclasses, workshops and performances in the department, and opportunities to get involved in the dynamic music scene in the city of Bristol. The department has a track record of international academic excellence and is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, with several of our staff running ensembles and performing with students.\nOn the language side of your degree, you will follow a structured language course in your chosen language, as well as explore the richness of the cultures in which it is spoken, taking a range of core and optional units in areas such as literature, film, history, thought, politics, linguistics and visual culture. You will spend your third year abroad in a country in which your language is spoken, extending your language skills and cultural knowledge. To find out more about studying abroad, visit the\nCentre for Study Abroad\n.\nBoth departments encourage strong synergy between research and teaching, as well as stimulating performance opportunities in music, resulting in a vibrant learning environment as staff respond to new research in their teaching.\nTeaching is delivered through lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, and one-to-one project supervision.

Our staff include some of the world's leading experts in their fields. Our graduates have gone on to be BBC producers, professional performers and composers, publishers, agents, lawyers, teachers, and even parliamentary private secretaries and university pro-vice-chancellors! A music degree from a highly regarded university is a fantastic entry point to a wide array of careers, and we stay in touch with a large number of former students, often via our ongoing work with music media (especially the BBC), publishers, choirs and orchestras.\nWe support our students' journey through their music degree with professional masterclasses and composition workshops for those who love performing and composing, while most of our history teaching is done in small group seminars where we share ideas on the latest research. We are exceptionally lucky to have first-rate professional musicians teaching our students who take performance, and students have many opportunities to develop as performers during their time with us, including conducting ensembles from small choirs to whole operas. For enquiries about organ and choral scholarships, please contact the Department directly.\nThe Department of Music webpages\nprovide further insight into life in one of the UK's most highly regarded Music departments.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAB\nA-level contextual offer:\nBBB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\n6 year(s) part-time.\nPart-time study with daytime, weekday teaching.\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nW300\n)\nApplicants for part-time study should contact the School directly at: sart-musicadmin@bristol.ac.uk\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a331,300 per year, international students\nPart-time tuition fees will normally be charged on a pro rata basis\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nIn your first year, you will take units in music history, composition (acoustic and electro-acoustic), performance and harmony. In your second year, you can begin to pursue your own interests, with a choice of history topics relating to the cutting-edge research being done by department staff, and pathways through composition and studio work, including recording and production. Performers continue with one-to-one professional tuition and work towards an end-of-year recital.\nSecond-year music students can, if they wish, spend half of the year studying at a university abroad; for more details, please contact the department directly. In your final year, you can take up to two extended topics, which can be either composition, studio work, performance or a dissertation; alongside these, you will select from a free choice of units and will also have the chance to work on a project collaboratively with your fellow students.\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

Our students reach a high level of attainment and are well-prepared for postgraduate study, both in philosophy and many other subjects.\nThis course equips you with skills, including textual analysis, clear written and verbal expression, collaborative problem solving, and critical thinking, that are valuable in a wide range of careers.\nIn your first year, you will gain a grounding in the fundamentals of philosophy through two mandatory introductory units: one exploring issues in epistemology and metaphysics and the other concerning moral and political philosophy. You will also take units in critical thinking and logic, and units which explore both historical and contemporary debates in value theory, metaphysics and epistemology. You may also take units outside the department in your first year.\nIn your second year, you complete your foundation in philosophy with a more advanced mandatory unit, which explores questions of what are real and foundational issues concerning normative domains, such as ethics. You will also have a range of optional units to choose from designed to help you develop your own core specialisation, explore different philosophical methods, engage in collaboration, and apply philosophical approaches to contemporary societal issues.\nIn your final year, you will work on an independent study unit on almost any topic in philosophy, writing an extended essay in consultation with a supervisor with expertise in your chosen area. You will again have a range of optional units to choose from including interdisciplinary units, units that are directly concerned with civic engagement and social philosophy, and units that invite self-reflection. These final-year taught units relate to the diverse research interests and expertise of staff, allowing you to engage with contemporary philosophical debates.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAA\nA-level contextual offer:\nABB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\n6 year(s) part-time.\nPart-time study with daytime, weekday teaching.\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nV500\n)\nApplicants for part-time study should contact the School directly at: sart-ugoffice@bristol.ac.uk\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a325,500 per year, international students\nPart-time tuition fees will normally be charged on a pro rata basis\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

Our courses are ranked 2nd in the Guardian subject rankings 2026.\nThis five-year degree has a strong core of clinical training supported by integrated learning of relevant sciences and technical skills. You will progress personally, academically, clinically and professionally, applying taught communication and teamworking skills when providing supervised dental care to a diverse range of patients in and around Bristol. You will learn to work within dental and wider healthcare teams and networks, demonstrating the knowledge, skills, and behaviours so you graduate as a safe practitioner.\nThe course structure comprises four main themes of development:\npractitioner,\nscholar and scientist,\nprofessional and agent of change,\nperson and citizen.\nYou will be introduced to basic concepts in the healthy patient before progressing to apply your knowledge and skills to prevent and treat a range of oral diseases. In the first year, you will become familiar with the clinic environment through peer group activities and observations. You will begin your dental practice under supervision in clinics after completion of simulated skills training undertaken in our new state-of-the-art facilities. From year two, you will treat patients with a wide variety, and increasing complexity, of oral and dental diseases in preparation for practice beyond graduation.\nAfter the third year, you can choose to intercalate in a subject of personal interest to obtain a BA, BSc, or even a Master's degree.\nStudent welfare is central to our programme and you will have access to a wide range of support, starting with our well-developed in-house personal tutor and senior tutor network, alongside support from the wider University.\nHealth and Disclosure and Barring Service check\nCertain health conditions may be incompatible with careers in dentistry. Before starting your degree, you will need to complete a health assessment questionnaire and pre-course screening for blood-borne viruses. These blood tests are to identify the few individuals whose health status may place them and/or future patients at risk.

To further strengthen the integration between Dentistry and Dental Therapy, the BSc Dental Hygiene and Therapy recently underwent a review; the School now offers applicants the option of applying for the Bachelor of Dental Hygiene or Bachelor of Dental Therapy. Please note you cannot apply for both programmes.\nThe course content, delivery and entry requirements have not changed significantly and students will cover the scope of practice of both Dental Hygienist and Dental Therapist. However, the course is now more aligned with the Bachelor Dental Surgery (BDS) in terms of structure and assessment strategy. The three-year full-time degree comprises integrated and compulsory units of academic teaching, clinical skills and practice with the completion of a dissertation in the Final year. Our courses are ranked 2nd in the Guardian subject rankings 2026.\nBased at the new Dental School in the city centre close to Bristol Temple Meads station, you will have access to cutting-edge technology working alongside experienced dental professionals in a world-class purpose-built facility. Ranked as the top Dental School in England (Complete University Guide 2025) our teaching delivers the latest developments in dental education and patient care.\nThe BDT equips you with the knowledge, skills and experience to practice safely within the scope of practice of a Dental Therapist as specified by the General Dental Council. With opportunities for community engagement, together with clinical rotations in Consultant led Oral Medicine and Orthodontic clinics you'll graduate from the University of Bristol as a competent and confident Dental Therapist.\nAs is standard for all new General Dental Council (GDC) registerable programmes, GDC approval will be confirmed after a successful inspection of the first cohort who join the programme in September 2025.\nYou will be eligible to register as a Dental Therapist and Dental Hygienist upon successful completion of the BDT.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nABB\nA-level contextual offer:\nBBC\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nB760\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\n,\nPlacements\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nIn year one, you will learn the fundamentals of biomedical sciences, tailored to Dental Therapy practice. The course combines asynchronous material with in-person lectures, seminars and practical classes. From Term 2 you will begin supervised patient care, including pain and anxiety control. Educational principles in Oral Health Promotion focusing on health concepts, behaviours and sociological influences are introduced.\nYou will focus on patient care in year two, enhancing your periodontal clinical skills, covering advanced treatment modalities and managing refractory cases. You will complete operative skills in restorative dentistry, for adults and children.  Dental radiology is introduced, and you'll start to deliver restorative patient care across various clinical settings broadening your understanding of treatments for paediatric and adult patients.\nIn year three, we focus on holistic patient care together with fulfilling the clinical requirements needed for graduation. You will complete a dissertation, and following completion of your final year assessments apply for registration with the General Dental Council.\nEach year includes four themes:\nFoundations for Practice: Core knowledge for safe and effective patient care.\nClinical Skills: Hands-on learning using manikin heads in the clinical skills suite.\nClinical Practice: Applying knowledge and skills in patient care at the Dental School clinics.\nPersonal and Professional Development: Becoming a well-rounded dental professional, understanding legal and ethical guidelines, and developing communication and leadership skills.\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

At Bristol, our interdisciplinary BSc Childhood Studies course focuses on children from birth to 19 years. We explore issues relating to perspectives on, and children's experiences of, education, care, work, justice, development, health, and rights and responsibilities in a national and international context.\nWith a holistic and in-depth understanding of children and childhoods, our graduates go on to successful employment in a range of connected areas. For example, recent graduate career destinations include: senior researchers and policy leads within the civil service and government, management positions in national children's charities and businesses, prison management, occupational health and speech and language therapists, educational psychologists, social work and teaching, children's rights advocates and lawyers, and further study or postgraduate qualifications funded by national and internationally competitive scholarships.\nOn our programme, you will consider childhood in the contexts of families, peers, communities, and society at a national and international level. Topics of study include children's education, rights, development, physical and mental health, psychology, safeguarding and protection, youth justice, and social harm, among others. The Childhood Studies team are all actively involved in research with children, their families and professionals, so your teaching is research-led, underpinned by the latest research and policy developments in the field. You will also receive bespoke teaching on research methods and ethical complexities involved in researching childhood.\nIn the first year, you will develop a solid understanding of the psychological, sociological and historical constructions of childhood, as well as contemporary issues affecting children such as child labour, child poverty and children's education. In the second and third years, you can choose optional units from a wide range of subjects, including a work placement unit, allowing you to pursue different routes through the degree toward a career path that is right for you. In your third year, you will complete a dissertation, allowing you to undertake your own research project on a topic of your choosing within Childhood Studies.\nFor the study abroad programme, you will study at one of our partner institutions overseas during year three (of a four-year course), where you can choose from social sciences, arts and humanities subjects.

You will also develop a deep knowledge of econometrics \u2013 the application of statistical methods to data to estimate economic models and test theories \u2013 as part of this degree.\nEconometrics is a vital tool for economists because, unlike natural sciences where controlled experiments are used to determine the effect of one thing on another, it is impossible to hold the economy constant while tinkering with a single variable. Econometrics provides the scientific means to overcome this issue using empirical observations.\nYou'll build an extensive core knowledge in econometrics, mathematics, data, statistics, machine learning and macro- and microeconomics. You'll also be able to tailor your degree to suit your interests and career ambitions with optional modules \u2013 exploring topics ranging from data science to accounting, behavioural economics to auditing, banking and finance to international business, and much more.\nYou'll also explore economics in a non-UK context during a year studying abroad, learning in English but at an international university in one of numerous global destinations available. Visit\nBristol Abroad\nto find out more.\nA dissertation will further enable you to apply your knowledge and skills in a specialist area, as you hone your research and analysis capabilities exploring a question of particular interest to you.\nYou'll benefit from teaching that's informed by the latest developments in economics and our cutting-edge research \u2013 research which ranks in the top five for economics and econometrics amongst UK universities (REF 2021). We are also home to the\nEconomics Network\n, which improves the teaching and learning of economics in universities throughout the UK and Europe.\nBy the end of the programme, you'll be well-prepared for a successful career. Recent BSc Economics and Econometrics graduates have gone on to work in roles such as Investment Analyst, Business Consultant, Data Analyst, and Infrastructure, Strategy and Operations Associate. They work at globally renowned organisations including KPMG, Siemens, and Aon.\nOn average, Bristol economics students earn 28% more than other UK economics graduates within five years of graduation \u2013 typically enjoying salaries between \u00a344,000 and \u00a387,000 per year (discoveruni.gov.uk, 2025).\nAccreditations\nOur Economics and Econometrics with Study Abroad BSc is accredited by\nCIMA\n.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nA*AA\nA-level contextual offer:\nAAB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n4  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nL142\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\n,\nPlacements\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a328,200 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nDuring the first, second and final years of this four-year degree, you'll study mandatory topics including data, micro- and macroeconomics, mathematics, statistical methods and machine learning.

You will have the fantastic opportunity to live and study abroad for a year at one of our partner universities. The degree is the same as the three-year\nBSc Economics and Management\ncourse until you get to your third year, which you will spend abroad studying modules in economics and management. You will return to Bristol for your final year.\nYour first year and half of your second year involve mandatory units which will give you a solid grounding in management and economics. This content ensures you have the depth of understanding which will enable you to explore what you find most interesting later on.\nHalf of your second year involves optional units, as does your entire final year. At least one-third of your final year must include units in economics and at least one-third from units in management. Otherwise, you are free to pursue your preferred discipline or to select options in accounting or finance (subject to conditions). You also have the choice to complete a management dissertation.\nTo find out more about studying abroad, visit the\nCentre for Study Abroad.\nFor the first 2 years of this course, teaching is delivered on the Clifton Campus where you will gain a thorough understanding of your subject.\nFor the final year of the course, students will also have some teaching at the new Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026, where enhanced links with businesses will provide students with real-world knowledge, networks and skills to succeed once you graduate.

You will also be well-placed to pursue careers in economic consultancy, government departments or market regulators, as well as specialist postgraduate studies.\nThis course provides rigorous training in all areas of finance with a focus on the quantitative skills that are required in every aspect of real-world decision-making. The cutting-edge computer languages Python and R are woven into the teaching of our quantitative modules. The degree is among the first in the UK to contain coverage of new and disruptive forms of finance at the undergraduate level, including cryptocurrencies, FinTech, Big Data analysis, smart beta investing, peer-to-peer lending or high-frequency trading.\nYou will learn to relate concepts and theories to financial practice through the use of specialist industry newspapers, including the Dow Jones\nFinancial News\nand data vendors such as Bloomberg and LSEG (formerly Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters Eikon).\nThrough core units and a choice of optional units, you will gain exposure to the related fields of economics, accounting, management and business law.\nFor the first 2 years of this course, teaching is delivered on the Clifton Campus where you will gain a thorough understanding of your subject. For the final year of the course, teaching will be delivered at the Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026, where enhanced links with businesses will provide students with real-world knowledge, networks and skills to succeed once you graduate.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAA\nA-level contextual offer:\nABB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nN300\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\n,\nTemple Quarter\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a328,200 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nThe first year of study will consider Finance in a mostly non-technical way while providing training in the quantitative subjects that later modules will build upon. You will also study Accounting and Economics.\nIn the second year, you will deepen your understanding of the theory, evidence and statistical methods relevant to different areas of Finance. You will learn to extract, process and combine the extremely diverse data used in financial decision-making in a dedicated module.\nAccording to your preferences and career ambitions, you will also be able to further your understanding of Economics and Accounting, building on first-year units, and develop your knowledge of Management or Business Law.\nThe final year will feature the most Finance content (both via core and optional units) along with advanced options in Economics, Accounting or Management, according to your professional goals. An innovative Digital Finance module will provide insights into new and disruptive forms of capital raising, trading and new assets and investment strategies.\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

International Social and Public Policy draws on several disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, behavioural science and philosophy, asking you to compare key ideas and theoretical frameworks.\nThis multidisciplinary, international degree integrates the analysis of government policy with the understanding of broader global political, economic and social change.

You will explore real-world challenges in a global context, drawing on social, political, public policy and economic theories.\nThis course allows you to add a specialism in the study of Criminology to the Social Policy degree. It explores the nature, extent and causes of crime, justice, social harm and deviance in national and international contexts, as well as examining the policy responses to them within a broader conceptual and theoretical framework of social policy and related social sciences subjects.\nSocial Policy at Bristol addresses some of the key questions of our time. What should we do about inequality? Why does poverty persist? What can be done about the climate crisis? How can citizens engage with policy? Adding Criminology extends this to questions such as: what are the serious crimes and other social harms that people experience? Why do they occur? How effective are criminal justice systems, policymakers and governments in tackling and responding to crimes and social harms?\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAB\nA-level contextual offer:\nBBB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n3  year(s) full-time.\n6 year(s) part-time.\nPart-time study with daytime, weekday teaching.\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nLM49\n)\nApplicants for part-time study should contact the School directly at: sps-ugadmin@bristol.ac.uk\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a325,500 per year, international students\nPart-time tuition fees will normally be charged on a pro rata basis\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nYour first year introduces key concepts and ideologies and familiarises you with theoretical, comparative and historical analyses. It also develops your research and critical thinking skills as a social scientist. Taking the Social Policy with Criminology course means that this will include an introduction to theoretical and conceptual debates about the meaning and existence of crime, harm and deviance in contemporary society, the way that crime is understood and represented, and the range of responses to various crimes.\nYour second and third years allow you to explore your interests in greater depth through a wide range of optional units which focus on contemporary, real-world social and political issues. You may also choose a work placement unit in the second year, providing the opportunity to gain employment-related skills and experience in an organisation connected to your studies.\nThe final-year dissertation is an opportunity to choose a topic for in-depth investigation and independent work.\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

This underpins our fundamental understanding of human health and disease and also supports applied science like drug discovery, diagnostics and biotechnology. Our Biochemistry course immerses you in ground-breaking research and allows you to develop high-level analytical and problem-solving skills that prepare you for a diverse range of careers. Our broad and varied curriculum currently includes contemporary topics such as molecular genetics, immunology, synthetic biology, drug discovery, recombinant engineering, enzymology, cellular homeostasis, cancer cell biology, developmental biology, and neurobiochemistry.\nThe first two years of the MSci are identical to our BSc programmes. You can tailor the course to suit your interests by combining your study of biochemistry with a choice of optional units. These include subjects relevant to molecular biology and biotechnology such as infectious disease, microbiology, pharmacology and physiology. Teaching is delivered through a combination of lectures, interactive workshops and small-group tutorials, and we achieve excellent student satisfaction. You are assigned a personal tutor at the start of the course who will usually remain with you throughout your degree.\nWe focus on the development of your practical and research skills throughout the first two years. As part of your third year, you will also participate in a laboratory-based research training unit which will further develop the skills needed to define and solve research problems.\nThe centrepiece of the MSci Biochemistry course is an extended research project that allows you to develop in-depth expertise in your area of specialism and acquire the skills required to embark on a research career. You will spend up to 16 weeks on an individual research project under the supervision of one of our research group leaders. This project is complemented by a unit on the wider context of scientific research called Science and Society. You will complete your studies by choosing two advanced units which could include Synthetic Biology, Cell Biology of Development and Disease, and Protein Assemblies and Molecular Machines.\nWe prepare you for your future career with subject-specific employability and enterprise sessions and the chance to gain research experience in a summer studentship. Recent graduate destinations from our biochemistry programmes include higher degrees such as a PhD, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies, research institutes, the NHS, graduate medicine, teaching, forensics, the civil service, medical publishing, finance, business consultancy, patent law, science communication and more.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nAAA\nA-level contextual offer:\nABB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n4  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nC791\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a333,400 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

This degree will equip you to find solutions to global environmental problems and design large and unique sustainable structures that shape society and enable human and ecological systems to flourish - for example, buildings, bridges, water supply systems, transport networks, renewable electricity generation and other critical infrastructure assets.\nThe course balances deep theoretical knowledge with practical application. At Bristol, you will be taught by academics working at the leading edge of civil engineering research and practice, and benefit from our world-class laboratory facilities, including one of the most advanced earthquake shaking tables in Europe.\nThe first two years provide a strong foundation in engineering, including mathematics, structures, soil and fluid mechanics, coding and surveying.\nDesign is central to the course and this is reflected in the projects and real-world challenges you will face. In the first year, you will develop a sustainable solution to an open-ended problem, such as designing and making a model bridge. The second year includes designing with steel, concrete and timber, geotechnical design and water engineering.\nIn your third year, you will undertake a major individual research project and continue to develop key practical and professional skills such as project management, entrepreneurship, economics and risk analysis.\nIn the fourth year, you will be able to choose from a range of units, tailoring your studies to your interests and career aspirations. You will also take part in an exciting group design project that combines all your learning as you tackle a realistic design challenge identified through our industry links. Design projects range from transportation to smart cities and from skyscrapers to sustainable housing.\nWe work closely with industry to ensure we equip you with the skills and experiences needed to become a future leader in civil engineering. Our graduates are highly sought after by top employers, including civil engineering consultancies and construction companies, utility companies, the military, public transport providers, sustainable electricity generators, and environmental managers.\nAccreditations\nOur Civil Engineering MEng is accredited by\nIHE\n,\nCIHT\n,\nIStructE\n,\nICE\nand\nPWI\n.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nA*AA\nA-level contextual offer:\nAAB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n4  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nH200\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a331,300 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nFirst-year students studying Aerospace Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Design Engineering all start their degrees with a broad knowledge of the fundamentals and a command of the skills that underpin modern engineering.\nYou will share common units with your peers in other disciplines and work on an interdisciplinary project, based on global challenges and inspired by\nEngineers Without Borders\n.\nYou will meet and work closely with more people from the start of your degree, broadening your social circle and long-term professional network.

This degree will equip you to find solutions to global environmental problems and design large and unique structures that shape society - for example, buildings, bridges, water supply systems, transport networks, renewable electricity generation and other critical infrastructure assets.\nThe course balances deep theoretical knowledge with practical application. At Bristol, you will also benefit from our world-class laboratory facilities, including one of the most advanced earthquake-shaking tables in Europe.\nThe first two and final two years of this course are shared with MEng Civil Engineering. You will spend your third year on a placement in industry, applying the knowledge you have gained during your first two years of study.\nThere's no direct entry into this course but you can transfer from our other civil engineering courses if you reach a high academic standard and are successful at a placement interview. Places are limited and highly competitive.\nThe first two years provide a strong foundation in engineering, including mathematics, structures, soil and fluid mechanics, coding and surveying.\nDesign is central to the course and this is reflected in the projects you will undertake. In the first year, you will develop a sustainable solution to an open-ended problem, such as designing and making a model bridge. The second year includes designing with steel, concrete and timber, geotechnical design and water engineering.\nReturning from your placement, you will carry out a major individual research project and continue to develop key practical and professional skills such as project management, entrepreneurship, economics and risk analysis.\nIn the final year, you will be able to choose units that tailor your studies to your interests and career aspirations. You will also take part in an exciting group design project that combines all your learning as you tackle a realistic design challenge. Projects range from transportation to smart cities and from skyscrapers to sustainable housing.\nWe work closely with industry to equip you with the skills and experiences needed to become a future leader in civil engineering. Our graduates are highly sought after by top employers, including civil engineering consultancies and construction companies, utility companies, the military, public transport providers, sustainable electricity generators, and environmental managers.\nYasmin completed a year in industry and found that it boosted her confidence, improved her career prospects and helped her develop a deeper appreciation for university life.\nWatch her story here.\nAccreditations\nOur Civil Engineering with a Year in Industry MEng is accredited by\nPWI\n.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n5  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nEntry by transfer\nYou must transfer to this course from BEng Civil Engineering (UCAS code H205), MEng Civil Engineering (H200) or MEng Civil Engineering with Study Abroad in a Modern Language (H201).

They will be team players with a breadth of skills and qualities that enable them to work across specialisms and cultures.\nThis course combines in-depth subject specialism at the university alongside interdisciplinary, practice-based learning. In conjunction with your history studies, you will apply your subject knowledge by translating ideas into innovative solutions, which may include plans for digital and creative enterprises, both social and commercial.\nThe course will equip you for researching and communicating history by treating you as a historian from day one. You will study a broad range of historic cultures and societies and have opportunities to explore life in the past from the medieval world to the modern day. You will develop your historical skills through a mix of core units, a wide choice of specialist optional units and substantial pieces of independent research. Small-group seminar teaching, supported by lectures and workshops, facilitates student discussion and debate.\nGroup work is a core component of teaching and learning in innovation. You will come together with students from other innovation disciplines, such as theatre, finance and electrical and electronic engineering. Each subject contributes a different perspective on a challenge as you identify needs and develop ideas. By drawing on your unique ideas and views on the world, you will learn from your subject and other students to develop innovative solutions together. You will also develop personal skills with opportunities for individual development and pursuit of topics and projects driven by your own interests and values.\nBy the time you graduate, you will have a portfolio of work ranging from live client projects to planning your own entrepreneurial venture. You will have learned how to evaluate the potential of products and services and how to sustain new endeavours including through financing.

This combination of depth and breadth enables you to develop innovative ways of thinking and provides you with an enviable range of abilities.\nLike the\nBA Liberal Arts\ndegree, this course encourages you to explore a wide range of subjects and issues. The first two years of the MLibArts course include core interdisciplinary units that embed the study of literature, history, philosophy, art, a foreign language and data into the degree. You will be able to take optional units and also begin to develop expertise in your specialist subject pathway, which you can choose from the disciplines on offer in the Faculty of Arts.\nA special feature of MLibArts is the opportunity to spend your third year studying abroad at one of our prestigious partner universities. To find out more about studying abroad, visit the\nCentre for Study Abroad.\nIf you are interested in the modern languages pathway, we strongly encourage you to enrol on the MLibArts course rather than the BA. Your year abroad will accelerate your language skills and provide an invaluable opportunity to develop your cultural knowledge.\nIn the fourth year of the MLibArts, you will take master's-level units. You will research and write an interdisciplinary, master's-level dissertation, drawing on the units you studied throughout your degree.

They will be team players with a breadth of skills and qualities that enable them to work across specialisms and cultures.\nThis course combines in-depth subject specialism at the university alongside interdisciplinary, practice-based learning. In conjunction with your music studies, you will apply your subject knowledge by translating ideas into innovative solutions, which may include plans for digital and creative enterprises, both social and commercial.\nThe Music Department offers a broad range of units in musicology, composition and performance*, across diverse styles and genres. These are complemented by weekly concerts, regular masterclasses and performances in the department, and opportunities to get involved in the many vocal and instrumental ensembles in the department and the dynamic music scene in the city of Bristol. You will be taught by internationally recognised musicologists and composers and by a team of professional instrumental and vocal tutors. Our teaching and music-making take place in the magnificent 19th-century Victoria Rooms, a familiar Bristol landmark with a 530-seat auditorium. A number of our students have secured organ and choral scholarships with our local churches and Bristol Cathedral.\nGroup work is a core component of teaching and learning in innovation. You will come together with students from other innovation disciplines, such as theatre, history and finance. Each subject contributes a different perspective on a challenge as you identify needs and develop ideas. By drawing on your unique ideas and views on the world, you will learn from your subject and other students to develop innovative solutions together. You will also develop personal skills with opportunities for individual development and pursuit of topics and projects driven by your interests and values.\nBy the time you graduate, you will have a portfolio of work ranging from live client projects to planning your entrepreneurial venture. You will have learned how to evaluate the potential of products and services, and how to sustain new endeavours including through financing. Importantly, you will have cultivated a network of peers and advisers who have worked with you through your studies.\n*In performance, we offer a wide range of instruments and vocal styles. If tuition on your particular instrument/vocal type is not currently offered in Bristol, you will be able to discuss options with the Department.\nFor more information visit the\nCentre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n.\nThe Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship will be located in the University\u2019s new Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026, where your Innovation units will be taught.

They will be team players with a breadth of skills and qualities that enable them to work across specialisms and cultures.\nThis course combines in-depth subject specialism at the university alongside interdisciplinary, practice-based learning. In conjunction with your theatre studies, you will apply your subject knowledge by translating ideas into innovative solutions, which may include plans for digital and creative enterprises, both social and commercial.\nThe course will equip you to use the critical, theoretical and practical skills central to the theatre, allowing you to develop your knowledge and skills across a range of areas as you proceed through the course. There are opportunities to engage with professional theatre-makers and our theatre archive, the Theatre Collection.\nGroup work is a core component of teaching and learning in innovation. You will come together with students from other innovation disciplines, such as film and television, history and accounting. Each subject contributes a different perspective on a challenge as you identify needs and develop ideas. By drawing on your unique ideas and views on the world, you will learn from your subject and other students to develop innovative solutions together. You will also develop personal skills with opportunities for individual development and pursuit of topics and projects driven by your own interests and values.\nBy the time you graduate, you will have a portfolio of work ranging from live client projects to planning your own entrepreneurial venture. You will have learned how to evaluate the potential of products and services, and how to sustain new endeavours including through financing. Importantly, you will have cultivated a network of peers and advisers who have worked with you through your studies.\nFor more information visit the\nCentre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n.\nThe Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship will be located in the University\u2019s new Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026, where your Innovation units will be taught.

The course emphasises the empirical study of the nervous system, mind and behaviour. We want our students to share a sense of fun and adventure in exploring and combining these different perspectives.\nMSci Psychology and Neuroscience are taught by experts who are enthusiastic about teaching students the latest developments in the field based on the research that they are conducting. In Psychology, use a variety of teaching methods (for example: lectures, seminars, tutorials, laboratory classes, group work) and assessment formats (for example: essays, research reports, in-class presentations, examinations). This variety of learning experiences caters for variations in students' learning styles and it is accredited by the\nBritish Psychological Society\n. It provides you with a pathway to becoming a professional psychologist. More generally, it provides you with knowledge and skills from both disciplines, which you can apply in a wide range of careers.\nIn the first year, you will be introduced to what psychology can reveal about the mind and human behaviour, and the neuroanatomical pathways and cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function.\nIn the second year, you will continue to develop your understanding of biological, cognitive, social, developmental and individual differences in psychology, alongside the different techniques used to study the nervous system.\nThe third year will continue your training in research design and analysis. You will also have the opportunity to focus on specific research areas, such as neurological and psychiatric disorders or interdisciplinary areas, such as behavioural and cognitive neuroscience.\nThe knowledge and skills you acquire culminate in your final year project, in which you will complete a substantial piece of original psychological research. In addition to subject-specific knowledge and skills, you will develop transferable skills, such as teamwork, critical thinking, scientific literacy, research skills, and both oral and written communication skills (including the skills involved in presenting to an audience). These skills are highly valued by employers across a wide range of industries. They will also help prepare you for postgraduate study in psychology, neuroscience and beyond.\nAccreditations\nOur Psychology and Neuroscience MSci is accredited by\nBPS\n.\nOverview\nTypical offer\nA-level standard offer:\nA*AA\nA-level contextual offer:\nAAB\nGo to\nentry requirements\nfor the full entry criteria and contextual offer eligibility.\nProgramme duration\n4  year(s) full-time.\nPart-time study is not available for this course\nApplication method\nUCAS (Code:\nCB81\n)\nLocation\nClifton campus\nFees\n\u00a39,535 per year, home students\n\u00a333,400 per year, international students\nMore about\ntuition fees, living costs and financial support\n.\nCourse structure\nFull details about the course structure and units for this course can be viewed in the programme catalogue.\nGo to programme catalogue\nEntry requirements\nWe accept a wide variety of qualifications and welcome applications from students of all backgrounds.

Vaccines and medications for treating lung and systemic diseases can be delivered by aerosol inhalation, and aerosols are widely used in agricultural and consumer products.\nAerosols are a key mediator of poor air quality and respiratory and cardiac health outcomes. Improving human health depends on insights from aerosol science on emission sources and transport, supported by standardised metrology. Similar challenges exist for understanding climate, with aerosol radiative forcing remaining uncertain.\nFurthermore, aerosol routes to the engineering and manufacture of new materials can provide greener, more sustainable alternatives to conventional approaches and offer routes to new high-performance materials that can sequester carbon dioxide.\nCandidates who aspire to work in a truly multidisciplinary field and who have an undergraduate background in any of the following areas are encouraged to apply: chemistry, physics, biological sciences, life and medical sciences, chemical and mechanical engineering, pharmacy and environmental sciences.\nYou will be based at the University of Bristol for the first seven months of your first year of this EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training. During this time, you will receive training in the underlying physical science governing the properties and transformation of aerosols. Training will be provided by academics and industrial partners using a team-based learning approach.\nYou will then undertake a short research project for three months that could be in one of the partnering universities (Bath, Birmingham, Cambridge, Hertfordshire, Imperial, Manchester or Surrey), giving you an opportunity to gain an insight into aerosols in an area complementary to your eventual PhD research. During year two or year three, you will undertake a placement hosted by the industrial partner supporting your project, giving you a perspective on aerosols outside the academic environment.\nIt is our expectation that our graduates will be agile experts, able to work at the many boundaries between the conventional disciplines where aerosols play a role.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nUp to four years full-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nThe CDT welcomes applications through\nour CDT in Aerosol Science website\n, from October 2025.\nShortlisted applicants will be invited to participate in the CDT recruitment and assessment events held regularly, from December 2025.

Our research on ecologies ranges broadly in time, with projects on human evolutionary pasts including the origin of sociality in primates, adaptation and extinction in apes, prehistorical changes in human societies and the evolution of cultural traits, and subsistence and dietary changes over millennia. We also focus on contemporary societies and how people respond to and live in the shadow of climate disasters. Research ranges broadly in terms of region, with projects in East Africa on fungi and food security and human behavioural ecology in relation to reproductive health; in South America on children and their relationship to both forest and urban environments in Peru and resource extraction and environmental destruction in Amazonia; in Asia exploring how people navigate and adapt to an international landscape of borders; and in the Pacific and Europe on the cultural uses of plants. We also bring this theme home to the southwest of England with archaeologies of changing landscapes and landscape usage from Prehistory to the present day.\nLiveable Futures:\nWhat is needed for life to be sustained? What conditions must be in place if we are to occupy a world that is habitable, and a society that enables human and non-human life to flourish? What challenges must we overcome to realise this vision of a hopeful and thriving future? Asking and answering such questions has always been at the heart of human experience, but we live at a moment where they are being posed anew in light of unprecedented contingencies and opportunities. Ecological emergencies. Faltering confidence in liberal democracy. Ever-accelerating technological transformations. These encounters shift our perceptions on what the future holds, as they provoke a collective \"soul searching\" on what it means to secure a liveable future for humanity, and even for life as such. Our research into Liveable Futures demonstrates how an anthropological perspective can contribute to and reshape this conversation.\nTurbulence and Transition:\nWhether affected by disease, drugs, changing diets, migrations, trauma, extractive practices, hurricanes, political shifts, or conflict we are interested in how humans live through and make sense of world altering events and everyday lived experiences. Our work is concerned with keeping pace with global changes - actively reflecting on, and reshaping anthropology and archaeology's approaches to, and impacts on our changing world. Our research projects track the challenges faced by human beings past and present, exploring how lives and material cultures are impacted by technological, social, and environmental change. Our research projects explore themes such as survival and resilience in the Caribbean in the face of destructive storms; the impacts of anarchy, civil war and rebellion in the southwest of medieval Britain; educational and linguistic transitions amongst ethnic groups in contemporary China; and how we can best support the survivors of sexual abuse.\nConnections and Creativity:\nHere we explore the possibilities for new forms of discovery and methodological engagement with past and contemporary societies. We are initiating, creating, and caretaking large-scale datasets that drive new forms of understanding, interpretation, and integration. We also have a growing expertise in multi-modal anthropological approaches and the deployment of visual and creative methods of engagement and cultural production. Our expertise foregrounds opportunities for collaboration, co-production and participatory methods, placing our department at the heart of contemporary issues.\nHow to apply\nApply via our online application system.

The large-scale experiments are executed in the SoFSI/EQUALS Research Infrastructure that includes the \u00a312 million UKCRIC National Facility for Soil Foundation Structure Interaction (SoFSI) and the long established EQUALS laboratory. This facility integrates structural and geotechnical engineering for soil structure testing and fills key gaps in our understanding which cannot be resolved using conventional, smaller scale laboratory tests or prototype observations. The SoFSI/EQUALS Laboratory can deliver a unique, high value capability for de-risking investments in innovation and development, for example in life extension techniques for existing infrastructure or the application of new materials and devices.\nThe group's area encompasses earthquake engineering, structural engineering, advanced composite materials, geomechanics and infrastructure resilience. It develops techniques for theoretical and numerical analysis, physical testing of infrastructure in the field and laboratory, advanced structural and geotechnical material behaviour characterisation and modelling, structural vulnerability and overall non-linear dynamic performance assessment. It has made notable advances in several areas, including the mechanisms of wind and pedestrian-induced vibrations, the non-linear dynamics of masonry and other buildings, dynamics of long-span bridges, cable structures, wind turbines, and seismic response of bridges and large dams. The research group also works on the analysis, design and assessment of earthquake-resistant structures, including novel numerical and analytical methods, retrofit techniques, risk studies, and on-site inspection of buildings, bridges and critical infrastructure.\nThe group has an active interest in solving geotechnical problems using a multi-scale approach, combining advanced laboratory testing, constitutive modelling, physical modelling, field observation and numerical simulation. Recent research has focused on measurements of deformation properties of soils using novel techniques of laboratory geophysics at very small strains for stiffness; dynamic soil-structure interaction, with an emphasis on piles and retaining walls; and foundations of offshore wind turbines.\nThe group also has a strong interest in the characterisation of treated geomaterials: mixtures of soil with various inclusions such as fibres, cement, fly ash and soft tyre chips. The Soil Mechanics Laboratory possesses a series of triaxial and a unique set of multiaxial soil test apparatus: true triaxial apparatus (independent variation of three principal stresses, rigid boundaries), cubical cell (independent variation of three principal stresses, flexible boundaries) and hollow cylindrical torsional apparatus (independent control of four stress variables).\nWater and Environment\nThe Water and Environmental Engineering research group is concerned with characterising and simulating the water environment in a changing world. We advance the sustainable use of water resources, provide design variables for infrastructure and enhance the security of society regarding floods and other environmental hazards. Focus areas include hydrology, water and health, climate change impacts, human impacts, water quality, risk from natural hazards, and new observational methods.\nWater and environmental security are crucial for the sustainable and safe existence of both people and nature. Ensuring water security requires protection from floods and water scarcity, and the sufficient supply of fresh water of appropriate quality to ensure environmental and human health. The future of our society is less likely to be threatened by armed conflict than by population growth, climate change, water shortages and pollution, as well as poverty and rising food prices. The water and environment research group focuses on developing the theory and tools needed to address the complex issue of water security in a changing world. The group consists of an interdisciplinary team of engineers and scientists who combine process understanding, mathematical modelling, novel monitoring approaches and engineering principles to solve societal water problems.\nSystems and Safety\nThe Infrastructure Systems research group develops novel, holistic approaches for characterising and managing the safe and sustainable performance of complex socio-technical systems. Key areas of work include sustainable systems, problem structuring methods, the vulnerability and resilience of infrastructures, infrastructure interdependencies, smart cities and communities, and the safety and vulnerability of embedded software systems.\nWithin the research group, the Safety Systems Research Centre performs novel research into the safe and resilient performance of complex systems, including computational and organisational factors. The centre is also part of the Bristol-Oxford Nuclear Research Centre, and Bristol's strategic relationship with EDF.\nThe Group also hosts the Infrastructure Collaboratory, Bristol's UKCRIC Urban Observatory facility, responsible for deploying testbeds across the city and developing novel solutions for monitoring traffic, air pollution, energy consumption, water quality and many other aspects of urban life.\nHow to apply\nPlease review the list of proposed supervisors above to identify a supervisor who may be suited to your proposed topic and approach. Your supervisor will lead on the key intellectual input in supporting your proposed research project. Please note, your primary supervisor should not be: an honorary or visiting member of staff, an emeritus or retired member of staff, currently registered for a research degree, a Research Associate or a Senior Research Associate.\nYou need to contact a potential supervisor to discuss available projects, and complete a\nSupervisor Suitability Form (Office document, 70kB)\n, before submitting an application.\nYou can then apply using our online application system.

By exploring new objects of study and innovative methodologies, we have forged interdisciplinary connections in and beyond the arts and social sciences via themes of global concern, from mental health to climate change.\nTransnational studies emphasise cultural difference and diversity yet also interconnectedness and mutual influence. We explore cultural contact, migration and transfer within and beyond Europe in uneven colonial, pre-colonial, and postcolonial contexts, both vertically and transversally, while questioning persistent narratives of 'West' and 'East', or 'North' and 'South'.\nIntermedial studies build on our excellence in word and image studies, film and theatre, auditory culture, and the study of such cultural artefacts as video games, graphic novels, manga, the media, landscape design, and artwork from video installation to graffiti. We also explore the materiality of discursive genres (poetic form, the novel, ego documents and political rhetoric), and how literary and discursive practices interact with social, political and professional contexts.\nComparative Literatures and Cultures draws on the extensive research specialisms of our staff. Each research student is assigned a supervisor who works in their proposed area of research or related field, and benefits from the input of a second supervisor who will likely come from another department, depending on the nature of the project.

As such, composites are replacing traditional materials for lightweight structures at an unprecedented rate due to global demand (for example in the aircraft, wind turbine, construction and automotive industries). The sector growth is expected to be rapid, in the region of 5-10% each year. With the already encroaching effects of climate change, composite materials and structures have an important role to play in contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions and the growing need for a more sustainable future.\nThe Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Composites Manufacture is a four-year postgraduate research programme, which integrates an industry-based research project with a taught programme in technical subjects related to composites materials, design, mechanics and manufacturing, as well as business skills and transferable skills training. Each EngD research project is designed around the sponsor company's research priorities.\nThe EngD programme is run by the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Innovation for Sustainable Composites Engineering. The CDT is led by\nBristol Composites Institute\nand the\nComposites Research Group at the University of Nottingham\n. EngD students benefit from the use of cutting-edge equipment and expertise at the universities and at the\nNational Composites Centre\n, which provides a world-class facility to bridge the gap between research and industrial application. A highly skilled workforce and technical leadership are required to support industry. Our programme promotes the development of a radical and innovative mindset that is necessary to make composite materials and structures one of the key enablers in a sustainable future.\nThe CDT aims to provide the UK composites sector with EngD graduates equipped with the advanced technical and leadership skills required for effective adoption of new knowledge and technologies in composites manufacture. The relevant industry areas include aerospace, automotive, marine, wind energy and construction. The research component is carried out in industry, with students spending 75% of their time located with their industrial sponsor. An integrated transferable skills training programme is included, covering communication, career development, innovation, management, and translational research skills. We have produced an exciting integrated programme enabling graduates to become leaders in sustainable composites engineering.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nUp to four years full-time (75% in industry).\nStart date\nSeptember or January.\nApplication deadline\nSee the\nISCE CDT website\nfor current application deadline.\nDelivery method\nOn-Campus\nLocation\nClifton\nAwards available\nEngD\nProgramme structure\nThe taught component comprises six units to provide an intellectually stimulating and inspiring educational framework that encourages innovation. In first year, you will study the fundamentals of composite materials, manufacturing and mechanics. Sustainability is included to encourage a holistic examination of the impact of the industry and future strategies for adopting composite materials in a framework of NetZero.\nIn year two, you will study units and follow professional development activities that cover innovation and business skills as well as design for manufacture and non-destructive evaluation techniques.\nIn year three, the Technology Transfer in Practice unit offers an opportunity to reflect on your research experience and its wider ranging impact on society through a secondment to a different sector.\nThe units are designed to engage you and provide an interdisciplinary view of composites, from materials chemistry to combining analytical and experimental techniques with modelling and practical application in a manufacturing context.

The critical element will place the creative work in an informed and theorised analytical context.\nThe total assessed word count will be 25,000 words for the MPhil and 80,000 words for the PhD (or equivalent for poetry). The proportion of the creative to the critical work will be agreed by the supervisory team, but in total will usually consist of around 65-70% of creative text and 30-35% of critical text.\nAll postgraduate research students are supervised by two academics, one of whom will normally be a creative writing academic and the other from English Literature or a discipline related to the creative and critical work. As with the traditional research degrees, the final submission will be expected to make 'a substantial and original contribution to knowledge'. For Creative Writing, this means a body of work that contributes in individual, significant and demonstrable ways to current discourses in literature.\nThe relation to such discourses will be articulated in the creative work and conceptualised and explored in the critical element; both are intended to address the same research questions, generating dynamic interplay between creative and critical practice.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nMPhil: one year full-time; two years part-time.\nPhD: up to four years full-time; up to eight years part-time.\nStart date\nJanuary 2026, September 2026, January 2027.\nApplication deadline\nJanuary 2026 start: 1 December 2025 for all applicants.\nSeptember 2026 start:\nOverseas applicants: 25 July 2026.\nHome applicants: 1 August 2026.\nJanuary 2027 start:\nOverseas applicants: 24 November 2026.\nHome applicants: 1 December 2026.\nThe deadlines for funding applications fall well in advance of these dates.

They range from traditional critical infrastructures, for example, water, power to emerging ones such as smart cities, intelligent transportation, Fintech and future banking, through to large social and business interaction platforms.\nCyber security is a hard challenge in any system. The ever-increasing interconnectivity and dependencies across the boundaries of such infrastructures make it an even harder one. Legacy (often insecure) and contemporary (secure or with hitherto undiscovered vulnerabilities) hardware, software and services are connected together, often on-the-fly, due to millions of user interactions. This is compounded by complex and changing supply chains with varying levels of security assurances and trust.\nThis next frontier in cyber security requires highly skilled professionals to proactively anticipate and address the implications for security and resilience through innovative fundamental research that will underpin future infrastructure architectures and products and services therein. However, there continues to be a major shortage of skilled cyber security professionals.\nPhD-level graduates are key to addressing this major shortage as they are the future research leaders with the capability to anticipate the challenges and develop innovative solutions.\nOur Cyber Secure Everywhere Centre for Doctoral Training offers research students an immersive challenge-led training approach by providing a unique co-creation experience with user partners to research overarching but linked thematic challenges. During our four-year programme, students learn from world-leading researchers from the Universities of Bristol and Bath, from each other as an interdisciplinary cohort, and also from industry experts.\nOur approach is fundamentally different from regular research training. Students learn from leading experts within multiple disciplines, including psychology, management, engineering, sociology and computer science. This approach provides a holistic understanding that is more attuned to the realities of tackling cyber security problems across complex IT, OT and IIoT systems.\nFull details of our programme, projects, cohort activities, supervisors and industry partners can be found on the\nCentre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security website\n.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nFour years full-time\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nRound 1-closing date 12th January 2026\nRound 2 -closing date 30th March 2026\nPlease note, this programme will close once places are filled.

Research in the School of Earth Sciences encourages interdisciplinary collaboration between its six research groups, which in turn nurtures revolutionary research.\nGeochemistry\nThe\nGeochemistry group\nuses fundamental chemical techniques to understand natural processes on a range of temporal and spatial scales. This can be from single atoms on mineral surfaces and the environmental geochemistry of the modern Earth to the large-scale chemical structure of planets and the birth of the solar system. The group has considerable expertise in isotopic measurements, spectroscopy and first-principles calculations.\nGeophysics\nGeophysics uses physical properties of the solid Earth to measure structure and processes on scales from the single crystal to the entire planet. Members of the Bristol\nGeophysics group\nuse gravity, seismic and satellite data to image the Earth in a variety of different contexts. These include the Earth's core, mantle and tectonic processes, volcanoes, oil and gas reservoirs and mines.\nEnvironments\nThe\nMATES (Marine and Terrestrial Environments)\nresearch group uses a wide range of techniques and facilities across the school to understand processes of relevance to any and all environments (surface, subsurface, marine) or that take place in an environmental context. MATES is highly interdisciplinary in both membership and the research that is undertaken, and spans the fields of Earth surface processes, environmental geochemistry and mineralogy, marine geosciences, fluid-rock interaction and geomicrobiology.\nPalaeobiology\nThe\nPalaeobiology group\nuses the fossil record to study the history of life. Research focuses on major diversifications; mass extinctions; dating the tree of life; phylogenomics and molecular palaeobiology; morphological innovation; biomechanics; and links between evolution and development. The organisms of interest range from foraminifera to dinosaurs.\nPetrology\nThe\nPetrology group\nuses a combination of high-pressure and high-temperature experiments, petrology, geochemistry and mineral physics to attack a wide range of problems in the solid Earth - from the core to the surface.\nVolcanology\nThe\nVolcanology group\nat Bristol aims to understand the physical processes underlying volcanic phenomena and develop methods of hazard and risk assessment that can be applied to volcanoes worldwide.\nRecent case studies and collaborators include the Met Office, Montserrat Volcano Observatory, Eyjafjallaj\u00c3\u00b6kull, Iceland and INGEOMINAS in Columbia.\nResearch centres\nThe School of Earth Sciences is involved in a number of collaborative research groups on an international level. Inter-faculty research centres involve collaboration across several departments and faculties.\nFull details can be found on\nschool research pages\n, with examples including:\nBristol Isotope Group\nThe Bristol Isotope Group is a world-class research facility for isotope measurements directed at understanding natural processes, from the formation of the solar system and the origin of Earth - its deep structure and atmosphere - through to the evolution of that atmosphere and contemporary climate change.\nThe Cabot Institute\nThe Cabot Institute carries out fundamental and responsive research on risks and uncertainty in a changing environment. Interests include climate change, natural hazards, food and energy security, resilience and governance, and human impacts on the environment.\nOrganic Geochemistry Unit\nThe Organic Geochemistry Unit (OGU) is an international research group that uses high-end analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry and compound specific light stable isotope mass spectrometry to investigate Earth systems at the molecular level.\nHow to apply\nIn the first instance, applicants should look for current opportunities\non the school website\nor contact potential supervisors to discuss projects and funding.\nPlease note:\nIf you are applying for this programme, you need to select\nGeology PhD\nor\nGeology MScR\nas the programme choice when completing your online application form.\nNote: For some schemes there may be additional guidance that you need to follow when completing your application.

Engineering Biology (EngBio) is an emerging field at the confluence of Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, AI and Data Science. It has the potential to provide innovative solutions to these challenges by harnessing biology in new ways and creating biomimetic and engineered living systems capable of surpassing what is possible from single-discipline approaches.\nThe Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Engineering Biology (EngBio CDT) will provide bespoke cohort-based training with a focus on how synthetic biology concepts and technologies can be translated into products with real-world impact.\nThis course is run jointly with the University of Oxford.\nAfter training in the fundamentals of mathematics, biology, engineering and computing, and undertaking team-based problem-solving projects, you will complete two short research projects, one of which will develop into your substantive PhD project. Throughout the course, you will undertake bespoke training in innovation and commercialisation, responsible innovation, EDI and bioethics, and career development.\nEach year, a summer school will take place in June/July which will include talks from engineering biology leaders, student pitches from innovation in engineering biology projects, and outreach projects.\nThrough close links with our industrial partners, and activities such as industrial placements, mentorship and translational training, the CDT will empower students to deliver EngBio solutions to real-world applications through skills and knowledge training.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nUp to four years full-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\n13 January 2026\nDelivery method\nOn-Campus\nLocation\nClifton\nUniversity of Oxford\nAwards available\nPhD\nProgramme structure\nThe first year will be divided into three segments.\nThe first segment will begin with induction weeks in both Bristol and Oxford. You will then receive around four weeks of foundation training (in Oxford). Students with a background in life sciences or engineering/physical sciences will receive foundation training in engineering or biology, respectively.\nThis will be followed by around six weeks of specialised training in engineering biology at the University of Bristol. It will include training in engineering biology design across scales (from biomolecules to cells), and advanced topics such as:\nModelling and control theory\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning\nGene circuit design\nProtein design and engineering\nTissue engineering.\nDuring the first four weeks of the second segment, you will work on your innovation in engineering biology group projects. This will be followed by the first of two individual short research projects.\nSegment three will comprise the second of these research projects and a summer school. Research will aim to align with four major focus areas:\nRobust methods for bioengineering;\nRational biomolecular and biosystems design;\nEvolution-guided biodesign;\nDigital cells and AI.\nPotential collaborative research projects will also be offered by the University of Oxford.\nOne of the two short research projects will typically develop into the substantive PhD project that you will work on throughout years two to four.\nView our unit and programme catalogue\nfor full details of the structure and unit content of our PhD Engineering Biology.\nWorld-leading research\n5th\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (\nTimes Higher Education\n).\n94%\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nFull REF 2021 results\nEntry requirements\nWe welcome applications from candidates who aspire to work in a multidisciplinary field.\nAs a minimum, applicants should hold or be predicted to achieve the following UK qualifications or their international equivalent: a first-class or strong upper second-class undergraduate degree with honours in engineering, biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, medicine or related disciplines.\nSee\ninternational equivalent qualifications\non the International Office website.\nAdmissions Statement\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nGo to admissions statement\nEnglish language requirements\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our\nprofile level E.\nFurther information about\nEnglish language requirements and profile levels\n.\nFees and funding\nHome: full-time\n\u00a35,106 per year\nHome: part-time\n\u00a32,553 per year\nOverseas: full-time\n\u00a327,500 per year\nFees are subject to an annual review.

Ensuring the safe and reliable function of engineered biosystems is of paramount importance for effective translation towards commercial applications. This theme will consider the integration of control engineering methodologies within the context of EngBio and explore the in silico and in vivo implementation of control algorithms to ensure reliable functions are maintained in complex and varying real-world environments. Exemplar project areas include: developing robotic platforms to automate and accelerate biodesign and prototyping; feedback control-based drug regimen design for cancer treatment; engineering of robust biocontrollers for metabolic engineering; resource-aware gene network design.\nRational biomolecular and biosystems design\n. Improvements in computational design can facilitate de novo design of biomolecules and their predictable assembly into larger, functional biosystems. This theme will build on advances in nanotechnology, structural modelling of proteins, and molecular dynamics to push the boundaries of rational biomolecular design for specific applications. Exemplar project areas include: nanoparticle-based vaccine design; metamaterials design and engineering; blood-cell engineering; synthetic protocells; high precision micro- and nano-encapsulation for healthcare.\nEvolution-guided biodesign\n. A characteristic of biology is its ability to evolve. However, evolution is often overlooked in EngBio. This theme will tackle this issue by demonstrating the unavoidable impact of evolution on the stability and function of biological designs, present methodologies to assess and design for evolution by either reducing the impact of evolutionary changes to increase the robustness of engineered biosystems, or by harnessing evolution itself as part of the design process (for example, directed evolution). Exemplar project areas include: evolution-aware biodesign workflows; directed evolution of bacteriophage to address antimicrobial resistance; evolvable cellular communities for healthcare; evolution-guided enzyme design.\nDigital cells and AI\n. Digital science is transforming how we approach biological design. This theme will build on advances in large mathematical models of entire cellular processes (for example, transcription, translation, and metabolism), as well as new data-centric approaches founded on AI and machine learning for the digital design of biological systems. Exemplar project areas include: generative AI approaches to de novo peptide and protein design; whole-cell model and AI-guided chassis design; design of microbial communities for energy recovery from waste water; development of mechano-chemical models for engineering wound healing in living tissues.\nHow to apply\nApply via our online application system.

Topics may directly explore policy or practice issues, or contribute more broadly to physical activity and nutrition knowledge, working with specific population groups and communities, addressing systems of inequality and social disadvantage. Where appropriate, students are encouraged to work in collaboration with relevant organisations and/or user and interest groups to ensure their research outputs and key findings can directly inform policy, professional development, practice and service delivery.\nSupervisors in Exercise, Nutrition and Health bring diverse interests across epidemiology (for example, associations between physical activity/diet and a range of chronic diseases across population groups); physical activity and dietary assessment (for example, development of indices to assess adherence to dietary patterns); the development and evaluation of physical activity and dietary interventions and/or services (for example, community programmes, school settings); and behaviour change (including the wider determinants of physical activity and diet and the psychological underpinnings of physical activity, nutrition and health).\nSupervisors also have diverse expertise in research methods, such as qualitative methods (for example, informing and evaluating the development of interventions or service delivery); secondary data analysis (for example, using nationally representative population surveys and large prospective studies/big data); and scoping and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the evidence base in physical activity and nutrition.\nThe school is an exciting environment for graduate studies, and PhD students become an integral part of our research community; we welcome graduate students from the UK and abroad to join our diverse and highly-rated research team.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nUp to four years full-time; up to eight years part-time.\nStart date\nWe welcome new PhD students all year round.

The result is research that makes a difference - EDF, Airbus and E.ON are just a few of the companies our students have worked with to create real impact.\nThe University of Bristol leads, alongside centre partners Imperial College London and the Universities of Manchester, Nottingham, Strathclyde and Warwick. The CDT has been co-created by a consortium of 49 companies, including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, EDF, BAE Systems and Shell.\nThe CDT has close links to the UK's internationally leading\nResearch Centre for Non Destructive Evaluation\nwith a vibrant network of more than 250 researchers across a range of disciplines based in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics and imaging sciences departments in the participating universities.\nWith these partners, we have developed bespoke cohort-based doctoral training to equip our CDT graduates with the breadth and depth of knowledge that UK industry requires across this multidisciplinary subject. EngD and PhD students will be trained by leading academic and industrial experts through taught modules on the core technical disciplines and an industrially linked doctoral research project.\nThis responds to rapidly changing needs of UK industry and a society that demands low costs with high levels of safety and reliability. This need is driven by many factors such as new materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, digitalisation, the Internet of Things, robotic systems, the civil nuclear renaissance and the pressing requirement to extend the life of our ageing national infrastructure.\nThe combination of breadth and depth of training equips our graduates with the broad interdisciplinary technical skills to deliver innovative solutions across key industrial sectors and the transferable skills needed to become future innovators and industry leaders.\nThe Bristol group is recognised as a world leader within NDE, having produced several important research outcomes that are now exploited by industry, both in the UK and around the world.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nPhD / EngD: Up to four years full-time; up to eight years part-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\n1 August 2026.

Studying linguistics allows you to develop your understanding of language, and therefore learn more about people, both as individuals and societies. This level of in-depth knowledge about the human condition is increasingly vital in a world facing a broad array of societal and environmental challenges.\nAt the University of Bristol, we have a strong research focus on sociolinguistics, which is the study of language in society. We are deeply interested in how the study of language sheds light on social issues, both present and past, and we use a broad range of methods and approaches, including qualitative and quantitative analyses of recordings, surveys, corpora, and historical documents. We examine language variation and change, using both present-day and historical data. We also adopt critical approaches that study the attitudes, belief systems and policies that influence the way people use language on a daily basis. As a PhD student, you will be able to apply all these approaches to your own data and develop your knowledge collaboratively with us as a team.\nIn our team, we have published extensively on many different language situations around the world, and our skills and expertise cover several languages: Catalan, English, Esperanto, French, German, Irish, Occitan, Portuguese, Scots, Spanish and Welsh. We also welcome working with students on other languages.\nBased in the\nSchool of Modern Languages\n, the staff in the Linguistics team collaborate nationally and internationally. We are connected with many professional bodies and networks, including the Association for French Language Studies, the International Association for the Study of Spanish in Society, the Forum for Germanic Language Studies, and the Historical Sociolinguistics Network. We work with colleagues from across the university (for example, in Anthropology and English) and we contribute to the\nresearch centres\nin the Faculty of Arts, Law and Social Sciences. These connections, our research events, and the support of our team offer an excellent research environment.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nMPhil: one year full-time; two years part-time.PhD: up to four years full-time; up to eight years part-time.\nStart date\nJanuary 2026, September 2026, January 2027.\nApplication deadline\nJanuary 2026 start: 1 December 2025 for all applicants.\nSeptember 2026 start:\nOverseas applicants: 25 July 2026.\nHome applicants: 1 August 2026.\nJanuary 2027 start:\nOverseas applicants 24 November 2026.\nHome applicants: 1 December 2026.\nThe deadlines for funding applications fall well in advance of these dates.

Crossing the fields of literary, media, technology, and accessibility studies, the programme allows you to develop deep disciplinary knowledge and skills alongside an ability to recognise the value of interdisciplinary approaches, and to use them to design your own research projects.\nA balance of individual and group work, combined with feedback from lecturers and peers, will allow you to grow in confidence as a transcultural thinker and communicator. You will express complex ideas in more than one language in an accessible and engaging manner, both verbally and in writing. The mandatory core units \u2013 Translation Practice and Analysis (Multilingual); Research Methods in Translation and Interdisciplinary Studies; and Language, Ethics, and Communication \u2013 equip you with practical and critical-reflective skills in translation and intercultural studies.\nOptional units from across the School and Faculty provide you with additional opportunities for specialisation according to your interests. Indicative optional units are offered in areas such as film, literature, AI, video games, and museums. With programme approval, you may also pursue supervised independent study projects and/or independent placement opportunities with external organisations.\nThe focus of the programme is on processes of translation, communication and intercultural exchange and not on the grammatical or stylistic norms of specific languages. The programme's multilingual format is intended to counteract power structures that favour a select group of the world's languages in terms of technological development and formal education.\nLinguistic diversity is therefore central to our mission.\nProficient users of English and any other additional language will be able to join our multilingual classroom. Where relevant, assignments will be submitted with literal/interlinear translations. Subject to staff availability, those seeking feedback on the grammatical or stylistic conventions of a specific language could undertake an assessed translation project in the Supervised Independent Study unit, involving a combination of the languages taught in the School.\nYou will be taught in lectures, seminars and workshops by experts from Bristol's School of Modern Languages and Faculty of Arts, Law, and Social Sciences. You will have access to the lively environment within the School where translators, interpreters and professionals with distinct skills and expertise contribute to a culture of shared learning and practice across our postgraduate programmes.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nOne year full-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nOverseas applicants: 27 August 2026.\nHome applicants: 21 September 2026.\nPlease note that due to high demand, some programmes may close earlier than advertised.

We also need to understand how the relationship with our environment is shaped by human behaviour, beliefs, values and structures. Studying how human interactions with the natural environment have changed over time, and how those interactions have been explored in culture, is essential to tackling contemporary environmental concerns.\nThis interdisciplinary master's combines the study of environmental history with that of literary texts concerned, in various ways, with the environment, while also reaching into other relevant disciplines including philosophy and anthropology. In addition, the programme offers an international perspective, exploring interactions between cultures and environments from across the world. Teaching methods include field trips and workshops as well as seminars and one-on-one tuition, while innovative assessment design encourages collaboration between students and enables them to develop\u00a0interests through practical projects (such as filmmaking and exhibition design) as well as more traditional essays.\nCompleting this course will allow you to:\nLearn directly from our experts working in the world-leading\nCentre for Environmental Humanities\nand benefit from the Centre's growing international and community partnerships, including the Greenhouse Center for Environmental Humanities at the University of Stavanger in Norway, and the Environmental Humanities Center at VU Amsterdam.\nDesign your own interdisciplinary pathway by combining core units on Environmental Humanities with a range of optional and open units across literature, history, modern languages, philosophy, and other disciplines.\nExplore real-world environmental challenges by working with our partners on real initiatives and solutions. You will have opportunities to engage with local organisations, community initiatives and creative practitioners, as well as with researchers at the\nCabot Institute for the Environment.\nDevelop vital communication and research skills in preparation to undertake large-scale research projects. The programme's innovative dissertation unit includes collaborative and practice-based options (past students have designed exhibitions, and produced short documentaries, for example) that support the development of practical and creative skills alongside academic research and writing.\nGain relevant skills for a number of careers. Sustainability is increasingly important, and opportunities include research and education, heritage and conservation, media and communications, politics, film and TV, and many more.\nStudy in a city well known for its green agenda and successful creative and technical economy. Bristol is a former European green capital, and the University hosts strong connections with multiple cultural organisations and community groups working on environmental projects.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nOne year full-time;Two years part-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nOverseas applicants: 27 August 2026.\nHome applicants: 21 September 2026.\nPlease note that due to high demand, some programmes may close earlier than advertised.

Crossing the fields of literary, media, technology, and accessibility studies, the programme allows you to develop deep disciplinary knowledge and skills alongside an ability to recognise the value of interdisciplinary approaches, and to use them to design your own research projects.\nA balance of individual and group work, combined with feedback from lecturers and peers, will allow you to grow in confidence as a transcultural thinker and communicator. You will express complex ideas in more than one language in an accessible and engaging manner, both verbally and in writing. The mandatory core units \u2013 Translation Practice and Analysis (Multilingual); Research Methods in Translation and Interdisciplinary Studies; and Language, Ethics, and Communication \u2013 equip you with practical and critical-reflective skills in translation and intercultural studies.\nOptional units from across the School and Faculty provide you with additional opportunities for specialisation according to your interests. Indicative optional units are offered in areas such as film, literature, AI, video games, and museums. With programme approval, you may also pursue supervised independent study projects and/or independent placement opportunities with external organisations.\nThe focus of the programme is on processes of translation, communication and intercultural exchange and not on the grammatical or stylistic norms of specific languages. The programme's multilingual format is intended to counteract power structures that favour a select group of the world's languages in terms of technological development and formal education.\nLinguistic diversity is therefore central to our mission.\nProficient users of English and any other additional language will be able to join our multilingual classroom. Where relevant, assignments will be submitted with literal/interlinear translations.

These activities are split into four overlapping themes: nonlinear dynamics, vibration suppression, experimental testing and control.\nSolid Mechanics\nSolid Mechanics is about understanding the way engineering materials respond to loading to improve the efficiency and safety of structures. The\nSolid Mechanics group\nat Bristol has a long tradition of undertaking industrially-motivated research, studying how materials behave when they are subjected to thermal and mechanical loads. The main interests of the group are residual stresses, fracture, fatigue and the behaviour of materials at high temperatures.\nEngineering Systems, Design and Innovation\nThe\nEngineering Systems, Design and Innovation group\nis concerned with researching and creating tools, methods, models and strategies to improve the engineering and operation of our future infrastructure and industrial systems. Fundamental to our research approach is the need to understand how the process of modelling relates to the process of practical intervention, with a particular focus on the methodological challenges of modelling and designing complex technical and socio-technical systems. The group's research interests and current projects reflect the industrial and societal challenges of energy, sustainability, resilience, demand responsiveness and flexibility, cost and frugality, users (stakeholders), risk and uncertainty, informatics and emerging technologies.\nUltrasonics and Non-destructive Testing\nThe\nUltrasonics and Non-destructive Testing group\nundertakes research into the fundamentals and applications of ultrasonics. We are particularly active in the following areas: array imaging; materials characterisation (for example, nonlinear ultrasonics); NDT of composites; structural health monitoring; ultrasonic particle manipulation (that is, acoustic radiation force devices). Our philosophy is to undertake a balance of fundamental engineering science ultrasonics research alongside more applied research. We see this mix of fundamental and applied as incredibly valuable and our aim is to see selected topics through from conception to industrial uptake. This means that most of our projects are collaborative, sometimes with industry and sometimes with other university groups.\nRobotics\nRobots are set to impact all aspects of our lives, from robotic exoskeletons that enhance our strength and mobility to robots that search for life in the solar system and beyond. Through the\nBristol Robotics Laboratory\n, an innovative collaboration between the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, Bristol is at the forefront of the robotics revolution. Our research in robotics spans many key areas from soft actuators and flying robots to safe systems and vision for robotics.\nFluid and Aerodynamics\nThe\nFluid and Aerodynamics group\nundertakes computational research (using numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyse problems that involve fluid flows) and experimental research. Areas of key current research include aerodynamic optimisation; computational aero-servo-elastics; hypersonic vehicle technologies; high-speed intakes; mesh deformation and generation; parallel processing; rotorcraft aerodynamics; incompressible flows; interface capturing and cavitation; nonlinear aeroelastic prediction; adaptive aeroelastic structures; aeroelastic design; and reduced order modelling.\nHow to apply\nPlease review the list of proposed supervisors above to identify a supervisor who may be suited to your proposed topic and approach. Your supervisor will lead on the key intellectual input in supporting your proposed research project. Please note, your primary supervisor should not be: an honorary or visiting member of staff, an emeritus or retired member of staff, currently registered for a research degree, a Research Associate or a Senior Research Associate.\nYou need to contact a potential supervisor to discuss available projects, and complete a\nSupervisor Suitability Form (Office document, 70kB)\n, before submitting an application.\nYou can then apply using our online application system.

This BPS-accredited MSc delivers the adult or paediatric knowledge and practice components required for advanced training in clinical neuropsychology. The paediatric pathway is available from January 2026 (part-time only). Applicants choose either the adult or paediatric pathway at registration.\nAround 80% of taught content is delivered by practising clinicians. We promote a biopsychosocial scientist-practitioner approach and advocate for research that informs patient care, with clinical practice grounded in active scientific engagement.\nTo accrue relevant clinical experience for the practice component, you must secure paid employment and supervision within a neuropsychology service during your enrolment. We offer support to help you build a case portfolio and ensure your clinical experience meets SRCN competency standards. This support is provided by clinicians on the SRCN and offers opportunities for feedback on case reports, including a practice viva experience, a mid-study review of progress and regular formulation workshops to facilitate peer discussion of cases and conceptual issues relevant to neuropsychological practice.\nThe programme is largely online and can be taken from home or work. Exams will be held online.\nWhile entrance to SRCN requires knowledge and practice competency (both of which this course delivers), it also requires evidence of a minimal level of research competency (usually doctoral level). Evidence for this is demonstrated by completion of a doctorate in clinical psychology, educational psychology or counselling psychology within 8 years of starting this degree. Applicants with non-doctoral backgrounds might include forensic psychologists, health psychologists, some counselling psychologists or some practitioner psychologist members of HCPC with international training backgrounds. If you do not meet the doctoral requirement or do not have a doctoral background, you can indicate the training you have undertaken and its research component on the Research Competencies Form submitted with your application.\nIf you wish to discuss your research competencies before application, please contact\npostgrad-psychology@bristol.ac.uk\n.

Modern software now underpins vast, complex systems across society, from energy and finance to healthcare and smart transport.\nThis new software ecosystem has also given rise to new forms of security threats, malware and system vulnerabilities. There is also now a heightened need from end-users, regulators and other stakeholders for accountability, privacy, and demonstrable and effective data protection measures from developers.\nThe consequence is an increased worldwide demand for software security experts who are able to understand the security challenges that modern software brings and offer strong solutions to mitigate harm to valuable software-enabled infrastructures. There is a major shortage of software security experts with the skills required to protect software-intensive businesses from disruption that can have large-scale impacts on society and massive business losses.\nA strong ethos of rigorous experimental and empirical cybersecurity and privacy research underpins the MSc, facilitated by a state-of-the-art testbed for studying threats and vulnerabilities related to data flows in the software and its dependencies (supply chain), critical national infrastructure (CNI) and Internet of Things (IoT).\nLeveraging our bespoke teaching equipment, you'll learn to apply foundational software techniques necessary to protect often interdependent software systems and will develop the skills for engineering scalable solutions. You'll be exposed to real-world problems that are practical and challenge-oriented but underpinned by rigorous research.\nThis MSc aims to:\nEnable a deep understanding of fundamental concepts, design principles, building blocks and methods to understand and mitigate against cyber threats that impact critical and complex software systems.\nGive you hands-on experience in articulating software security issues by working with devices, systems and networks utilised in realistic environments such as state-of-the-art testbeds for inter-meshed systems, CNI and IoT.\nEquip you with the ability to apply these security principles in analysing cybersecurity problems and challenges from a variety of vantage points: networks, systems, human factors and risk, control systems and Internet of Things devices, reason about the security and privacy properties of underlying software and implications in large-scale and inter-meshed settings.\nEnable you to apply secure software engineering principles and lifecycle to design and implement software solutions that proactively and reactively address security and privacy issues by default.\nProvide you with the skills to reason critically about complex problems that require evaluation and analysis from a multi-dimensional perspective including technical, human and organisational aspects.\nTeaching for this postgraduate programme will be delivered at our new Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, opening 2026. Home to our pioneering research groups and designed to enhance links with industry in collaborative spaces, students will gain the networks, skills and knowledge to succeed once you graduate.

These changing socio-economic dynamics, alongside processes such as climate change, transnational migration and globalisation, demand a global consideration of the state of the planet. Reflecting these trends, concepts of 'development' have evolved away from an understanding of something that takes place in the 'Third World' or 'Global South' and towards notions of global 'Sustainable Development.'\nContemporary global challenges demand the linking of environmental issues to conventional foci of development (like health, urbanisation, poverty, food security and migration). They also demand an understanding of how the world's resources (such as water, energy, land, minerals, demography) are allocated and managed, and how contestations over these distributions play out.\nThe MSc Global Development and Environment programme is aimed at talented graduates seeking to develop or enhance their expertise in the fields of development and environment.\nWe welcome a diverse array of students from different subject backgrounds interested in the large-scale drivers of environmental consumption and stewardship, and how these interlink with and produce developmental outcomes.\nYou will explore the relationship between international, environmental and developmental concerns and current socio-political events.

This MSc will enable you to apply economic and policy theory and practice for this purpose, and to a range of complex challenges facing the global community (for example inequalities, mental health, infectious disease, climate change, health and social care provision). The programme will teach you key concepts in economics and policy by drawing on real-world examples from international and UK contexts. This applied focus will ensure you are able to communicate and share economic and policy thinking and evidence with various audiences, including policymakers, academics, and the general public.\nYou will learn a range of analytical techniques and research methods used by professional health economists and policy analysts, including statistics and econometrics, economic evaluation, qualitative and survey methods, evidence synthesis and modelling. You will also gain valuable practical experience in using appropriate software for qualitative and statistical data analysis, and for building economic models, so that you can confidently select and creatively apply these methods and software in your future careers and make sound, methodological judgements in the absence of complete data.\nThis MSc encourages you to apply multidisciplinary skills and a multi-stakeholder perspective to health and care challenges. The programme therefore welcomes professionals and students from multiple backgrounds. This MSc is particularly suitable for professionals who have experience of working within health care, social care or pharmaceutical settings, and graduates with a degree in economics, health sciences, mathematics, statistics, social policy or pharmacology.\nThis programme is available as an intercalated degree for current undergraduate medicine, dentistry or veterinary students from the University of Bristol or other universities.

The MSc Interpreting builds a highly versatile portfolio of skills that provide an entryway into the world of professional interpreting and related fields such as international business.\nNative English students may have an undergraduate degree in Chinese Studies or experience working in China for example, while native Mandarin speakers might have come from a variety of undergraduate disciplinary backgrounds while having developed an advanced level of English.\nStudents will be trained in consecutive, simultaneous, and liaison interpreting with native English and Mandarin experts. Through shadowing, mock conferences, simulations, and field trips, you will learn key techniques and build skills for professional interpreting. The course also covers business fundamentals, international affairs, AI-assisted tools, trauma-informed approaches, communication models, and text-based translation.\nAs essential participants in cross-cultural and multilingual interactions, interpreters can be found at every level of global society. More than just linguistic intermediaries, interpreters interface with a broad range of scenarios, from grief counselling in the medical field to the highest level of international diplomacy between world leaders through institutions such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Interpreters represent not only the most proficient experts in multiple languages, but also those who develop a unique multidisciplinary understanding and ability to perform under extremely high-pressure conditions.\nWhile traditional interpreter training has focused mainly on interpreting skills, our programme takes things one step further by directly engaging with the secondary competencies often displayed by experienced interpreters but seldom taught systematically at postgraduate level. By offering training in areas such as psychometrics and negotiation, the MSc Interpreting curriculum branches into subjects that build students' understanding and confidence across a range of parallel fields.\nThe structure of the course allows for students to specialise in different directions in the second semester as their understanding of their future career goals continues to develop with the help of their personal tutor. Some will prefer to choose to major exclusively in interpreting disciplines, while others may wish to branch out into audiovisual translation or lay a foundation for PhD study and a career involving academic research.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nOne year full-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nOverseas applicants: 27 August 2026.\nHome applicants: 21 September 2026.\nPlease note that due to high demand, some programmes may close earlier than advertised.

The expertise of the core teaching team is supplemented by contributions from guest lecturers from across industry and international organisations, allowing students to expand their knowledge in new areas with input from both cutting-edge researchers and professionals.\nWith a mixture of lectures, seminars, and practical skills workshops, the classroom experience is collaborative and dynamic, and students will develop a professional development plan that tracks progress throughout their studies in subject-specific and transferable skills.\nPractical interpretation training covers the whole range of modes, such as consecutive, simultaneous, and liaison interpreting, while also developing enhanced memory and presentation skills. Activities are designed to be engaging and foster peer support. Personal tutoring is a key component, with tutors who are professional interpreters guiding students through their personal development journey.\nAll students take Simultaneous Interpreting and Augmented Intelligence Technologies in the second semester, accompanied by a choice of two other units specialising in commercial and/or public service interpreting disciplines, with an option to branch out into other related fields such as Film or Games Localisation with optional units drawn from the MA Chinese-English Translation programme.\nThe final dissertation offers options for traditional research, practice-based projects, or work-study projects involving summer internships.\nVisit our programme catalogue\nfor full details of the structure and unit content for our MSc Interpreting.\nWorld-leading research\n5th\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (\nTimes Higher Education\n).\n94%\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nFull REF 2021 results\nEntry requirements\nFor native Chinese speakers, you will typically need an upper second-class honours (60% entry req) degree or international equivalent in any subject.\nFor non-native Chinese speakers, you will typically need an upper second-class honours (60% entry req) degree or international equivalent in Chinese Studies (or similar), or completion of a full undergraduate or postgraduate programme at a prestigious Chinese institution.\nNon-native Chinese speakers who have not completed a Chinese/Mandarin bachelor's may be required to demonstrate proficiency through a translation test.\nNon-traditional qualifications/routes may also be considered.\nFor applicants who are currently completing a degree, we understand that their final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades they achieve during their studies.\nWe will consider applicants whose interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements.

This programme focuses on developing your skills in research, policy, and practice in these connected fields. The development of these skills is vital in addressing genuine issues of concern to policymakers and practitioners nationally and globally.\nYou will be taught by academics who are at the forefront of real-world research and whose knowledge is grounded in applied situations. Recent collaborations have seen research undertaken with the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Obesity Federation, the National Health Service (Meals on Wheels) and national governments in the West Pacific Region.\nYou will learn to address questions such as:\nWhat is the policy implication?\nWhat research design will answer this question?\nWhat intervention needs to happen?\nHow will it be evaluated?\nThis will be invaluable in roles where you may be required to pitch your future projects to policymakers, commissioners, and funders. Skills gained in critical thinking, report writing, and evaluation of research and interventions will also be transferable to your future career.\nThe programme will help you critically examine key interactions at the interface of epidemiology, behaviour change and policy-relevant research in these connected fields and will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of the evidence around the role of nutrition and physical activity in public health; the factors that influence people's physical activity and eating behaviours; and how to develop and evaluate nutrition and physical activity interventions.\nIt will suit graduates or professionals (with or without directly relevant experience or qualifications) who are interested in pursuing a career in nutrition, physical activity, public health or relevant fields. The complex and inter-disciplinary nature of these issues mean the skills developed during this programme are useful in a wide range of career paths.\nThe programme is delivered over one year, allowing you to return to work, progress your career and start to bring your knowledge into practice in a short period of time.

Our clinical programmes aim to engage and inspire clinicians to enhance their skills in clinical neuropsychology and support entry onto the British Psychological Society's (BPS) Specialist Register of Clinical Neuropsychologists (SRCN). This certificate is accredited by the BPS and will support you in developing the practice competencies required for entry onto SRCN. This degree is for applicants pursuing qualification in adult or paediatric neuropsychology.\nTo accrue relevant clinical experience for this degree, it's your responsibility to secure paid employment within a neuropsychology service during your enrolment in the certificate. It's also your responsibility to secure supervision for your work when enrolled on the course. However, we provide additional oversight and support towards developing your case portfolio and helping you to ensure your clinical experience demonstrates the required competencies for entry to the SRCN. This support is provided by clinicians on the SRCN and offers opportunities for feedback on case reports, including a practice viva experience and a review of your progress halfway through your study with us. There are also regular formulation workshops to facilitate peer discussion of cases and conceptual issues relevant to neuropsychological practice.\nThis programme is largely online and can be taken from home or work, with the viva for the clinical practice dissertation taking place online.\nWhile entrance to SRCN requires knowledge and practice competency (the latter delivered on this course), it also requires evidence of a minimal level of research competency (usually doctoral level). Evidence for this competency is demonstrated by completion of a doctorate in clinical psychology, educational psychology or counselling psychology within 8 years of starting this degree. Applicants with non-doctoral backgrounds might include forensic psychologists, health psychologists, some counselling psychologists or some practitioner psychologist members of HCPC with international training backgrounds. If you do not meet the 8 year doctoral requirement or do not have a doctoral background, you can indicate the training you have undertaken and its research component on the Research Competencies Form submitted with your application.\nShould you wish to discuss your research competencies with our team before application, please contact\npostgrad-psychology@bristol.ac.uk\n. Checking research competency status is an issue for any UK programme supporting entry to the SRCN.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nOne year full-time;\nTwo years part-time;\nThree years part-time.\nStart date\nJanuary 2026\nSeptember 2026\nJanuary 2027\nApplication deadline\nFor January 2026 start: 24 November 2025.\nFor September 2026 start: 21 September 2026.\nFor January 2027 start: 24 November 2026.\nPlease note that due to high demand, some programmes may close earlier than advertised.

At Bristol, we see clinical neuropsychology as representing the interface between the biological, psychological and social facets of human behaviour. This programme covers elements of basic human neuropsychology but has a strong focus on clinical neuropsychology. \\you will learn about a range of neuropsychological disorders and pathologies, as well as focusing on principles of assessment, formulation and rehabilitation. We also cover neuroanatomy, neuroscience methods and theories of brain function.\nThis degree is delivered in partnership with North Bristol NHS Trust. We are passionate about neuropsychology and its application to society to improve the well-being and quality of life of those affected by damage, disease or dysfunction affecting the brain.\nThe taught content of the Diploma is identical to the taught content we provide when training UK-qualified clinical psychologists to specialise in clinical neuropsychology. The programme therefore covers core content dictated by the British Psychological Society and delivers an authentic reflection of clinical practice. While this programme is not formally accredited by the BPS, if you complete this Diploma and then go on to study a BPS-accredited doctorate in clinical psychology or counselling psychology, your Diploma could be retrospectively recognised as meeting one of the key professional requirements for entry to the BPS Specialist Register of Clinical Neuropsychologists. Should you wish to become a qualified clinical neuropsychologist, this retrospective recognition of prior learning could save around two years of study time and the cost of paying for a BPS-accredited Diploma in Clinical Neuropsychology.\nAround 80% of our taught content is delivered by practising clinicians, and you will also receive weekly clinical tutorials (during term) that allow you to discuss different aspects of programme content and help prepare you for a range of career options. This programme is suitable for those looking to pursue a research career, professional positions (such as an Assistant Psychologist) or further clinical training (such as a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology).\nThere is also an\nonline version\nof this programme for international students wishing to study from your home country and some UK-based students may wish to consult with us if you wish to take this degree online.

Please note that for the neuropsychology training on this Diploma to be recognised within the UK, you would also need to take a UK Doctorate in Clinical Psychology or Counselling Psychology that was professionally accredited by the British Psychological Society.\nGraduates of our Applied courses who later become Practitioner Psychologists and are registered with the UK Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) can enrol on our supplementary certificate courses in clinical practice and have their prior Diploma course with us count toward recognition as a professional neuropsychologist. This opportunity requires HCPC registration as a clinical or counselling psychologist.\nAll countries face healthcare challenges associated with brain injury and disease. Conditions such as stroke and dementia are common, and their prevalence is increasing as people live longer. The need for clinical neuropsychologists could not be greater. We offer professional training to clinicians within the UK.

Our clinical programmes aim to engage and inspire clinicians to enhance their skills in Clinical Neuropsychology and support entry on to the Specialist Register of Clinical Neuropsychologists (SRCN). This diploma delivers either the adult or paediatric knowledge component of the competency requirements for advanced training in clinical neuropsychology. The paediatric pathways is only available for January 2026 intake and thereafter and must be studied part time.\nAround 80% of the taught content is delivered by practising clinicians. We promote a biopsychosocial scientist-practitioner approach and strongly advocate for neuropsychological research to be relevant and applicable to patient care, and for clinical practice to be underpinned by a thorough and ongoing engagement with scientific research/evidence.\nThe programme is largely online and can be taken from home or work. In-person attendance at teaching weeks (two per year for part-time study) is encouraged but is not mandatory, and this flexibility suits those with busy professional lives, family responsibilities, disability and other factors impacting travel to Bristol. Lectures are recorded and can be watched live or whenever is convenient, and exams/timed assessments will be held online.\nIf you are interested in this course because you want to enter the SRCN, then you will also need to complete the practice component (our\nCertificate in Clinical Neuropsychology Practice\n).\nThis programme delivers one of three requirements for entrance to the SRCN \u2013 the knowledge component.

To be eligible to apply to this degree, you must be studying a DClinPsych at a UK University which has a collaborative agreement with the University of Bristol. You can find\na list of collaborating institutions at the bottom of this page.\nAround 80% of the taught content is delivered by practising clinicians. You will learn about a range of neuropsychological disorders and pathologies, as well as focusing on principles of assessment, formulation and rehabilitation.\nTo accrue relevant clinical experience for the practice component of this degree, it's your responsibility to secure paid employment within a neuropsychology service during your enrolment in the diploma. It's also your responsibility to secure supervision for your work when enrolled on the course. However, we provide additional oversight and support towards developing your case portfolio and helping to ensure that your clinical experience demonstrates the required competencies for entry to the SRCN. This support is provided by clinicians on the SRCN and offers opportunities for feedback on case reports, including a practice viva experience, a mid-study review of progress and regular formulation workshops to facilitate peer discussion of cases and conceptual issues relevant to neuropsychological practice.\nThis programme is largely online and can be taken from home or work. If you're interested in applying to this programme, you may wish to discuss the process with your DClinPsych team and find out\nhow to apply\n.\nOur courses delivering the practice component require evidence of research competencies meeting standards and requirements for entry to the SRCN.

Society needs AI experts with the ability to act as a bridge between domain experts and AI technology.\nBut rather than delivering 'AI for x' experts for a fixed domain 'x', which might quickly lose its importance or utility, our Practice-Oriented Artificial Intelligence (PrO-AI) doctoral training programme will deliver experts with the flexibility to adapt to new domains over the course of their career. The PrO-AI CDT pulls together the University of Bristol's proven track record in AI (AI university of the year 2024) and cohort-based doctoral training, to deliver highly-trained AI innovators with the transferable skills to deliver societal impact across domains.\nThe first year of the programme is a balance of flipped classroom style lectures, seminars, workshops, and group and independent projects. This training offers a first-class foundation for developing and completing a PhD project with our wide range of academic supervisors.\nBeyond the first year, you will focus on your PhD project in addition to cohort and cross-cohort activities.\nThroughout your programme you will participate in and build an online portfolio of transferable skills training inspired by the\nVitae Researcher Development Framework\n. This includes training in areas such as responsible innovation, entrepreneurship, hosting visitors, organising events, public engagement, and citizen science.\nFull details of our programme can be found on the\nCentre for Doctoral Training in Practice-Oriented Artificial Intelligence website\n.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nFour years full-time\nStart date\n14 September 2026\nApplication deadline\nApplication deadlines will be advertised on our CDT in Practice-Oriented Artificial Intelligence\nwebsite\n.\nPlease note that due to high demand, the programme may close earlier than advertised. Early applications are advised to avoid disappointment. Places are limited and allocated on a continuous basis until all places are filled.\nDelivery method\nOn-Campus\nLocation\nClifton\nAwards available\nPhD\nProgramme structure\nThe PrO-AI training programme consists of a Foundation Year (a combination of modules involving group and independent research, seminars, workshops and skills training) followed by three years of PhD study and research.\nThe Foundation year modules are:\nPractice Projects\nwhich offers 'deep dives' into a research domain. You will liaise with domain experts to get an understanding of their expertise, expectations and success criteria. Exploring different domains will allow you to acquire the transferable skills that will be key when moving between domains in your future career.\nFoundations of Practice-Oriented AI\nwhich runs in a student-led, 'flipped-classroom' style. Academic mentors attend the sessions to assess their mentee's knowledge and identify areas where further study will be beneficial. The module covers:\nthe main topics in data-driven AI, knowledge-intensive AI and human-AI interaction;\nhuman-centred and participatory methodologies to bring those AI techniques into practice;\nand the legal and ethical context that will help students to do so responsibly and, in a manner, beneficial to society.\nA\nSummer Project\nwhich provides the opportunity to undertake an extended research idea of your choice, which may develop into your PhD topic.\nFollowing the Foundation year, you will progress to the PhD research component of the programme.\nFull details of our programme can be found on the\nCentre for Doctoral Training in Practice-Oriented Artificial Intelligence website\n.\nWorld-leading research\n5th\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (\nTimes Higher Education\n).\n94%\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nFull REF 2021 results\nEntry requirements\nApplicants must hold/achieve a minimum of an upper-second class honours degree (or international equivalent) in a relevant discipline.\nThe CDT is primarily aimed at students with a first class degree in engineering or science and with strong programming skills, but applicants with suitable skills acquired in employment will also be considered. Applicants need to have prior knowledge and experience with selected contemporary AI techniques and demonstrate this in their application.\nSee\ninternational equivalent qualifications\non the International Office website.\nAdmissions Statement\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nGo to admissions statement\nEnglish language requirements\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our\nprofile level E.\nFurther information about\nEnglish language requirements and profile levels\n.\nFees and funding\nHome: full-time\n\u00a35,106 per year\nHome: part-time\n\u00a32,553 per year\nOverseas: full-time\n\u00a327,500 per year\nFees are subject to an annual review.

To be classed as a home student, applicants must meet the required residency criteria set out by UKRI. Information can be found on the\nUKRI website\n.\nInternational students\nIf you do not meet the above criteria, you will be classed as an international student.\nA limited number (up to 30%) of UKRI fully-funded studentships are available through the PrOAI CDT for international applicants.\nPlease note, these studentships do not cover the costs associated with obtaining a visa (including healthcare surcharge) or relocating to the UK.\nSelf-funded or sponsored international students are welcome to apply.\nFurther information on funding\nfor prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nCareer prospects\nGraduates will have the sought-after skills to adapt quickly to a problem domain in science and research that they haven't worked in previously. They can become part of new and existing world-class research groups, as well as pursue highly rewarding careers in a variety of industries around the world.\nOur industry partners cover a broad range of AI technologies and play different roles in enhancing the PrO-AI training programme.

It supports both fundamental and applied research that will enable new forms of computation, sensing, and communications that address major societal challenges. Combining the expertise at the University of Bristol and the University of Sussex, the aim of the QIST CDT is to train the UK's best quantum scientists and engineers, capable of working in all areas of the burgeoning QIST ecosystem.\nThe QIST CDT boasts a bespoke training model, an evolution of the decade-long Quantum Engineering CDT, tailored to the training needs of QIST that disrupts the tradition of training PhD graduates for academic careers. At the core of the programme you will receive cutting-edge training in experimental and theoretical quantum information and quantum technologies. Furthermore, you will receive specialised training in entrepreneurship, project management, academic practice, science policy, and communication skills. Uniquely this CDT allows students to design their own PhD project after the first year of being immersed in the breadth of quantum research at the University. This holistic programme will hone your ability to work effectively in diverse teams, with peers from varied backgrounds in physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering and computer science.\nThe first year of the programme is a balance of taught courses, seminars, workshops, and group and independent research projects, with both theoretical and practical aspects. This training offers a first-class foundation for developing and completing a PhD project with our wide range of academic and non-academic supervisors and partners. This cohort approach to learning creates an environment that is both stimulating and empowering. It also supports the creation, growth and development of personal and professional networks from the first day, broadening your knowledge and enabling you to put your research into context.\nThe QIST CDT training extends beyond the first year, with cohort and cross-cohort activities, alongside multiple chances to explore professional opportunities, from academic secondments, to industrial placements and internships with our partners working on science communication, outreach, science policy and entrepreneurship.\nUltimately, the CDT offers the opportunity to undertake world-class postgraduate research coupled with an unrivalled opportunity to learn and understand the foundations of quantum physics and then apply them to real-world situations to help shape the future of the quantum information science and technology sector.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nUp to four years full-time\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nPlease see the\nQIST CDT webpage\nfor deadlines.\nInterviews for a September 2026 start are likely to take place in March 2026.\nDelivery method\nOn-Campus\nLocation\nClifton\nAwards available\nPhD\nProgramme structure\nYear 1 is a cohort-based training programme with modules delivered by the University of Bristol and the University of Sussex plus either one 6-month-long independent research project or two 3-month-long exploratory research projects.

Students are encouraged to develop a topic of interest that directly relates to their own practice experiences or is of wider interest and relevance to the delivery of social work services and support to disadvantaged individuals and groups, either in the UK or overseas.\nStudents will be supported to develop research questions and design a study that enables them to rigorously research their topic of interest and make an original contribution to the knowledge base of social work. Topics may directly explore practice issues or contribute more broadly to social work knowledge, working with specific groups and communities and addressing systems of inequality and social disadvantage. Where appropriate, students are encouraged to work in collaboration with relevant organisations and user and interest groups to ensure their research outputs and key findings can directly inform social work practice and service delivery.\nWe are a multidisciplinary, research-intensive school which brings together theory, policy and practice. Our research engages with and influences national and international policy. Our policy experts come from a wide variety of backgrounds in social policy research, social work, sociology, gender violence, childhood studies, disability studies, health and social care, history, human geography, economics, psychology, physical activity, nutrition and health sciences, urban studies, and poverty, based within seven specialist research centres.\nSupervisors in social work bring diverse interests across child and family social work (for example, looked after children; adoption and fostering; supporting parents with substance misuse or learning disabilities; domestic violence responses and interventions) and adult social care (for example, disabled adults' social care needs; housing and homelessness; mental health social work; social work with older people and carers; inclusive service provision for LGBTQ+ individuals).\nThe school is an exciting environment for postgraduate studies; we welcome students from the UK and abroad to join our diverse and highly-rated research team.

The subject area is at the forefront of efforts to reduce use of fossil fuels, improve healthcare and develop novel quantum technologies. The training aspects of the CDT will give students holistic knowledge of the various aspects of superconductivity, ranging from the fundamental science, through the development of new materials and the optimisation of existing ones, and to the use of superconductors for applications ranging from magnets for nuclear fusion reactors and magnetic resonance imaging machines, power transmission, and quantum devices such as those uses for quantum computing applications. The programme will draw on knowledge from Physics, Chemistry, Materials science and Engineering. The programme includes training in transferrable skills such as writing and presentations skills, outreach and public engagements, and business and entrepreneurship.\nA key aspect of the programme is that it has an emphasis on encouraging students to work together both as a cohort and between different year groups. It contains several specific mechanisms to promote cohort development. These include three cohort-wide residential training weeks distributed over the academic year, an annual conference, cross-cohort group projects and seminars, and shared mentoring. Students will benefit from each other's knowledge and insights, understanding and taking interest in problems outside of their specialism and contributing to each other's progress and training through peer-to-peer learning.\nStudents are recruited to the CDT to work on specific research projects. A list of available projects is available to\nview here\n.\nKey information\nProgramme duration\nPhD: four years full-time; eight years part-time.\nStart date\nSeptember 2026\nApplication deadline\nThe Centre for Doctoral Training welcomes applications through our\nEPSRC CDT in Superconductivity website\n, from October 2025.\nShortlisted applicants will be invited to participate in the CDT recruitment and assessment events held regularly, from December 2025.

This is accomplished through a balance of taught courses, seminars, and group and independent research projects, with both theoretical and practical aspects. The course is delivered in partnership between the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge and Oxford. Our industrial and facility partners enrich these courses by delivering lectures that demonstrate real-world applications of superconducting technologies within their organisations.\nA central aspect of the programme is the PhD Research project. This begins right at the start of the course and continues throughout, thus giving students perspective on the taught part of the course and building engagement.\nVisit our programme catalogue\nfor full details of the structure and unit content for our PhD in Superconductivity.\nWorld-leading research\n5th\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (\nTimes Higher Education\n).\n94%\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nFull REF 2021 results\nEntry requirements\nA master's qualification, or be working towards a master's qualification, or international equivalent.

Many of our graduates go on to pursue academic positions in universities, performing a range of research, teaching and clinical roles. Other graduates have been recruited by research institutes (for example, BBSRC), government bodies (for example, Defra) or industry (for example, pharmaceutical, animal feed) where they perform research and advisory roles. Some veterinary graduates perform specialist clinical activities in veterinary practices.\nResearch groups\nResearch activities in the school\nare focused on two research themes and encompass both clinical excellence and strong basic science.\nOur themes\nPopulation Health\nThis theme embodies a multidisciplinary approach to studying the health of populations, spanning molecules to communities of animals including the human animal through One Health approaches.\nGlobal Food Security\nResearch in this theme addresses major challenges to sustainable intensification of livestock production, including epidemiology, infectious disease, nutrition and management, 'One Health', parasitology, veterinary public health, animal behaviour and animal welfare.\nOur underpinning research communities\nInterdisciplinary and cross-theme/group research is encouraged and supported. There are five Research Communities underpinning our two main themes:\nAnimal Welfare and Behaviour\nThis spans fundamental studies of cognition and emotion - through validation of animal welfare assessment methodologies - identifying and quantifying welfare problems and their causes in farm, laboratory, companion and working animals, as well as to implementing research-based solutions in the real world.\nInfection, Inflammation and Immunotherapy\nThe community brings together several research strengths ranging from the fundamental to more applied research with potential for impact, which all collectively benefit from being part of a university-wide infection and immunity research theme. The research areas include immunology, microbiology, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, infectious diseases, zoonoses, parasitology and social science approaches.\nClinical Research\nThis community focuses on naturally-occurring diseases within the clinical caseload and is directed towards the prevention and treatment of animal and human diseases. This community brings together veterinary clinical specialists engaged in high-quality clinical research, working in new clinical and imaging facilities, with biomedical scientists who study fundamental physiological mechanisms and disease processes.\nOne Health Approaches to Antimicrobial Resistance\n(AMR)\nResearch is promoted and facilitated by the 'AMR Force', an active and inclusive group of enthusiastic researchers. Work is carried out in the South West, nationally and internationally, and the team are interested in decreasing antibiotic use while improving animal health through a plurality of approaches addressing differing styles and attitudes.\nVeterinary Education\nResearch in veterinary education is a rapidly growing field at Bristol's Veterinary School. This group aims to promote evidence-based teaching and assessment methods within a nurturing and supportive environment.\nData platforms and infrastructure\nThe school has a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to realising 21st century veterinary research and is developing platform technologies, data analytics and biobanking facilities to support cohort studies and high-quality clinical trials. With the completion of both the\nCIEL poultry research facility\nand the\nThe John Oldacre Centre for Dairy Welfare & Sustainability\n, a highly instrumented dairy farm on site, a wide range of data-intensive studies are possible to tackle grand challenges in both animal and human health. These studies are supported by strong links to data-intensive research and facilities across the University.\nInterdisciplinary research is a major strength of the school and is reflected by our participation in these University and UK initiatives:\nFood Security and Land Research Alliance\nSouth West Biosciences Doctoral Training Programme\nElizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research\nCabot Institute for the Environment\nJean Golding Institute\nfor Data Intensive Research\nThe Alan Turing Institute\n, UK institute for data science and artificial intelligence\nCentre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock\n.\nHow to apply\nApply today via our online application system.
