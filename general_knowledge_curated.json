Early Resolution is an optional and informal process and does not change your right to submit a formal academic appeal.\n\nYou should submit the Early Resolution Service form within 14 calendar days of getting your exam board outcome\n\nThe Early Resolution Service can help you:\n\nunderstand what your\n\nresults and programme outcome\n\nmean\n\ncheck if your marks or penalties have been recorded correctly\n\nconfirm if\n\nyour exceptional circumstances\n\nwere considered by the Board of Examiners and what was done as a result\n\nidentify if there has been an administrative error and get advice on what to do next\n\ncheck whether you have an acceptable reason for not\n\nsubmitting exceptional circumstances\n\nSubmit an Early Resolution form\n\nStudent visas\n\nIf you are on a Student visa, speak to the\n\nStudent Visa team\n\n. They can tell you how the appeal process and outcome might affect your visa status.\n\nBristol SU academic advice\n\nTo get help with preparing a formal appeal, use\n\nBristol SU\u2019s Academic Advice\n\nservice.\n\nYou can use the appeal wizard to create a draft form. Then the Academic Advice team will review it and provide advice, including\n\nguidance on supporting documents to provide\n\n.\n\nTheir advice is independent, free and confidential.\n\nWhen you can appeal\n\nIf you need help understanding your\n\nexam board outcomes\n\n, use the Early Resolution Service.\n\nYou can appeal against an\n\nofficial decision of the Board of Examiners\n\n.\u00a0Your\n\nprogramme outcome\n\nwill state if it is possible to appeal. This is published after the Board of Examiners meeting and you will receive a notification by email.\n\nYou should only appeal if you think you have valid grounds. Appeals that do not have valid grounds will be dismissed.\n\nYou can also appeal the requirement to attend an\n\nAcademic Integrity Awareness Course\n\n.\n\nReasons for an appeal\n\nThere are three different grounds for appeal:\n\nA. Appeals relating to material irregularity\n\nThere has been a material irregularity in the decision-making process sufficient to require that the decision can be reconsidered. Examples of this are if the University has not applied its regulations correctly or if the Board of Examiners failed to consider exceptional circumstances that you had submitted before the board meeting.\n\nB. Appeals relating to undisclosed exceptional circumstances\n\nBefore appealing on this ground, read our guidance on\n\nappeals based on undisclosed exceptional circumstances\n\n.\n\nYour performance in assessment was affected by illness or other factors (\n\nexceptional circumstances\n\n) which you were unable, for good reason, to divulge before the meeting of the Board of Examiners. Your appeal will need to explain clearly why you could not submit these in advance of the exceptional circumstances form deadline.\n\nC. Appeals relating to disproportionate impact\n\nA penalty for cheating or plagiarism is wrong or has had a disproportionate impact on your outcome.\n\nWhen you cannot appeal\n\nYou can't challenge matters of academic judgement. These are decisions that can only be made with the opinion of an academic expert, including decisions about what mark you have been given for a piece of academic work. Submitting exceptional circumstances does not mean your marks will change (except where a late submission penalty or word count penalty has been lifted).\n\nYou can only appeal against an official decision of the Board of Examiners as indicated in your\n\nprogramme outcome\n\n. Decisions about progression are usually made official at the end of the academic year in June (or in August where you have completed work during the reassessment period). Award decisions are normally made for undergraduate students in June, and for postgraduate taught students in November or December. In most cases, appeals are not permitted following mid-year exam boards, which take place in January.\n\nIf the appeal procedure is not applicable you may wish to\n\nmake a complaint\n\n. A complaint is not another way to challenge a Board of Examiners decision or academic judgement.\n\nHow to make an academic appeal\n\nYou have 21 days (includes weekends but not public holidays in England or\n\nuniversity closure days\n\n) to submit an academic appeal from the date you receive your decision.\n\nYou should submit your appeal as soon as possible to help you prepare for your next academic year.\n\nDownload a\n\nStudent Appeal Form\n\n.\u200c\n\nRead the\n\nUniversity Assessment Regulations (PDF, 337kB)\n\n, Section 12.\n\nOrganise any documents\n\nyou believe support your appeal. All supporting documents should be submitted with the appeal form. If there is a good reason why you cannot submit supporting documents at the same time as the form, please submit the form as soon as you can with an explanation of what supporting documents are outstanding. Do not delay submitting the form.\n\nComplete all sections of the appeal form.\n\nKeep your responses clear, succinct, and within the recommended word counts.\n\nYou may want to include a timeline, use bullet points, or cite relevant regulations to help set out your information.\n\nWhen submitting supporting documents, give each one a clear name and use that name whenever you mention it in your appeal form.\n\nClearly outline which outcome you want.\n\nYour university email account will close soon after your studies end. Make sure on your appeal form that you provide another email address to your university address.\n\nEmail the completed form and all supporting documents to\n\nstudent-appeals@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nIf you miss the deadline\n\nIf you cannot submit your appeal by the deadline, email a completed\n\nlate appeal request form\n\nto\n\nappeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nWhile you are awaiting your outcome\n\nUntil you receive the outcome of your appeal, the exam board decision as published still applies.\n\nYou must follow the exam board decision and complete any work required. Do not assume that your appeal will be successful. It may not be possible to process an appeal against the requirement to complete a supplementary year of study before the start of the next academic year or in time for you to re-join your programme in your original cohort.\n\nFailure to follow the programme outcome that you have been given may affect your progression or award.\n\nWhat happens after you submit an appeal\n\nThe Student Resolution Service will acknowledge receipt of your appeal by email to your university email address and any others you provide on your appeal form. They will contact you if further information is required, or if your form is not fully completed.\n\nYour Faculty will review your appeal.\n\nThe Student Resolution Service will keep you updated on the progress of your appeal.\n\nYou will receive the outcome with next steps by email. This usually arrives within 35 days (includes weekends but does not include\n\npublic holidays in England or University closure days\n\n) of submitting your appeal.\n\nIf you do not hear the outcome within 35 days, you can contact the Student Resolution Service by email:\n\nstudent-appeals@bristol.ac.uk\n\nfor an update.\n\nPotential appeal outcomes\n\nWhen making an appeal, you should ensure you are clear on which outcome you are seeking. Possible outcomes include:\n\npermission to progress to next year of study;\n\npermission to undertake a\n\nsupplementary year\n\nto complete failed unit(s) to satisfactory standard (this may be with or without attendance);\n\npermission to repeat the year in its entirety;\n\npermission to re-register for programme of study following a required to withdraw decision;\n\npermission to remain on programme of study and not be required to transfer to alternative programme of study;\n\nuplift of degree classification;\n\nremoval of penalties or caps to unit/assessment level outcomes.\n\nYou cannot use the appeals process to ask for your work to be re-marked.\n\nAfter receiving your appeal outcome\n\nThe appeal outcome letter will include information on next steps, including how to progress your appeal if you are not satisfied with the outcome, as detailed in the\n\nUniversity Assessment Regulations\n\n, Section 12. You will receive this letter by email directly from your faculty.\n\nYou should be aware of section 12.7 of the University Assessment Regulations. This states that appeals will not be permitted at the University Stage if one or more of the requested outcomes has been permitted at the Local Stage.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with your local stage outcome, you can appeal to the University stage by completing the\n\nAppeal Progression Form\n\nand sending it to\n\nappeal-progression@bristol.ac.uk\n\nwithin 14 days (includes weekends but does not include\n\npublic holidays in England or university closure days\n\n) of the local stage decision. More information will be provided in your local stage outcome letter.\n\nOther types of appeal\n\nAcademic Integrity Awareness Course\n\nYou can appeal the requirement to attend an Academic Integrity Awareness Course (AIAC).\n\nYou have 21 days (including weekends) to appeal from the day you are contacted about attending an AIAC. This does not include English public holidays or\n\nuniversity closure days\n\n.\n\nTo appeal, you must:\n\nDownload the\n\nAcademic Integrity Awareness Course appeal form (Office document, 61kB)\n\nComplete all sections\n\nSubmit the form to\n\nstudent-appeals@bristol.ac.uk\n\nAfter you submit your appeal\n\nIf we need more information from you, the Student Resolution Service will contact you.\n\nYour Faculty will review your appeal and decide whether to confirm or remove your requirement to attend the AIAC.\n\nYou must still attend the AIAC while your appeal is under review.\n\nIf you are concerned or worried\n\nContact the\n\nStudent Wellbeing Service\n\nif you'd like to talk to someone about:\n\nhow you're feeling\n\nhow you might discuss your exam board outcome with your family\n\nany other worries related to the process."

More examples are on\n\nCite Them Right\u2019s website.\n\nHow to avoid plagiarism\n\nTo avoid plagiarism, you should:\n\nuse citations and reference\n\nideas or work that are not yours\n\nwrite essays in your own words\n\nonly include other people\u2019s ideas within your work when they support your argument or to prove a point/ theory\n\nonly use direct quotations if necessary (focus on ideas instead)\n\nreference all quotations, paraphrases, statistics, tables, figures, data, diagrams or images that you use\n\nnever copy and paste from the internet.\n\nImprove your research skills using our\n\nUniversity Library\u2019s resources.\n\nTo check how to reference correctly, refer to your faculty, school or course handbook. For support, you can\n\ncontact your subject librarian\n\n.\n\nHow we identify plagiarism\n\nOur academics can use software to help them decide if plagiarism has happened. The software will create a report, showing similarities between your work and other people's work.\n\nWe use two\n\nSimilarity detection services (Office document, 73kB)\n\n:\n\nTurnitin UK is used to check most individual assessments. You may also use it to review your work if your school gives you the option to do it.\n\nSafeAssign is used for group assessments and some individual assessments.\n\nWhat happens if you plagiarise\n\nIf we think you might have plagiarised, we will invite you to a meeting with staff in your school to discuss this. During this meeting, we will explain why we think you have plagiarised and ask how you created your work.\n\nIf you are being investigated for plagiarism, you can contact\n\nBristol SU Academic Advice\n\nfor free and impartial advice and support.\n\nIf you are found to have plagiarised, you will be penalised according to\n\nthe University regulations."

This means you must attend all classes and complete any required assessments. It may also be possible to have a supplementary year without attending classes, where you only need to complete the assessments. In this case, you wouldn\u2019t need to attend the teaching sessions. You would just take the assessment during the designated assessment period.\n\nThe board will consider the following when deciding whether to allow a supplementary year without attendance:\n\nthe number of credits you still need to earn\n\nthe reasons for failing your units (e.g. failing to submit work)\n\nhow actively you engaged with the teaching\n\nthe type of assessments you need to complete\n\nwhether the necessary units will be available next year.\n\nRequest to change supplementary year attendance status\n\nIf, after reviewing this information, you believe there\u2019s a good reason to change the attendance status for your supplementary year, you can\n\nsubmit a request on the university website\n\nwithin 7 days after your results are released.

You may be required to suspend your studies and come back at the start of the next academic year on the new programme. This may involve an additional year of study.\n\nAfter the end of your first year with progression into the second year (undergraduate only).\n\nWhere the structures of the two programmes are sufficiently similar so that you will not be academically disadvantaged by the transfer. This might include picking up or dropping a year in industry, or transferring to or from a Joint Honours, where programme regulations allow. For example, a transfer between:\n\n'BSc Physics' and 'BSc Physics with industrial experience', or\n\nMSci Biochemistry and BSc Biochemistry.\n\nWhere you wish to transfer to or from an integrated masters programme (for example from a BSc to a MSci).\n\nWhere you wish to transfer to a study abroad programme. Places cannot be guaranteed due to the limited spaces available at partner universities. Contact the\n\nBristol Abroad team\n\nfor more information.\n\nWhere your PGR programme regulations allow (for PGR students only).\n\nWhen you cannot transfer\n\nTransfers are not always possible. For example, if:\n\nIt is not within the first two weeks of teaching\n\nthe programme you want to transfer to is full, or\n\nyou do not meet the entry requirements.\n\nGet advice before transferring programme\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about changing programme, the best place to start is to speak to your personal tutor or supervisor (for PGR students) for advice. They will be able to help you make an informed decision and help you consider any other academic support that may be suitable.\n\nThey will also help you decide if you would like to continue with your existing programme (in the event that you cannot transfer right away).\n\nThere is support and guidance available\n\nthrough the support services\n\nthat can help you manage your studies. You can also\n\nrequest wellbeing support\n\nwhile at the university.\n\nFunding\n\nYou should discuss with the money, advice and funding office how transferring to a new programme may impact your funding.\n\nYou should also\n\ncheck whether the tuition fees are different for your new programme\n\n.\n\nStudent visa holder students\n\nBefore requesting a transfer, you must review the information on the Student Visas\n\ntransferring your course\n\nwebpage. You may need to apply for a new visa or apply for ATAS clearance.\n\nStudents on other types of visa\n\nIf you are subject to UK immigration control and hold a non-Student visa, your transfer may be conditional on\n\nreceiving ATAS clearance.\n\nIf the course you are transferring to has an ATAS requirement and your nationality is not exempt from it, you must obtain an ATAS certificate for the new course before you can transfer. You can contact\n\nStudent Visa Advisers\n\nfor further guidance.\n\nPlacements\n\nIf you are suspending before transferring onto a placement programme (for example, in industry or studying abroad), we will try to allocate a placement to you when you return from suspension along with the next cohort of students. This cannot be guaranteed.\n\nSee the suspensions guidance for more information\n\non how suspending can impact your studies.\n\nAccommodation\n\nIf you are required to suspend before transferring, on your return to study, you may need to apply for accommodation as a returning student, and university-owned accommodation is very limited. Find out more about\n\nhow suspending your studies may affect your accommodation\n\n.\n\nHow to request a programme transfer\n\nOnce you have spoken to your personal tutor or supervisor, speak to your current school office for advice in the first instance. They will explain how you can make the necessary requests:\n\nIf the programme you want to join is in another school, contact the school office for that school to ask if they will consider your transfer request. You will need to understand what year of study you would be able to enter and if there are any other transfer requirements, such as specific units you need to study or pass. See the prospectus webpage for more information.\n\nIf you are required to suspend your studies before transferring programme, you must complete a suspension of studies form, which your current school can give you, and you must submit this to your current school office for approval alongside your programme transfer form.\n\nContact your current school office to request a transfer form. Fill it in and get the approval of your new school and faculty, on the form, before submitting the completed form to your current school for approval.\n\nIf you are a student visa holder, the school will email the form to you and Cc Student Visas. A Student Visa Adviser will provide visa advice by email and/or on the form (if applicable).\n\nIf you hold a visa that is not a Student visa, your new programme has an ATAS requirement and your nationality is not exempt from it, please ensure you have obtained an ATAS certificate for this course before you formally request the transfer.\n\nOnce approved by your current school, your request will be shared with your current faculty, and with the school and faculty that own the programme to which you are requesting to transfer. You will then receive an email to confirm the change once the accepting our new faculty has processed the transfer. This may be at the end of the current academic year. Until you've received written confirmation, you must either continue studying on your current programme of study or formally request a suspension of studies (if you cannot transfer until the next academic year).\n\nFor detailed regulations about changing from one undergraduate course to another, read the University\u2019s\n\npolicy on transferring\n\n.\n\nSuspending your studies prior to transferring programme\n\nIf you are required to suspend your studies prior to transferring programmes, you will stay on your original programme for the duration of your suspension. Nearer to your return, your faculty office will contact you to ask if you intend to return. If you do, your student record will be reactivated and your new faculty will process your programme transfer at that time. If you have any questions, contact the faculty that owns your new programme.\n\nOnce the transfer process is complete, you will receive an email confirmation."

In this case you will need to apply for\n\nreturner accommodation\n\n. It is important to note that returner accommodation is very limited.\n\nAccess to university services\n\nYour\n\nUCard\n\nwill no longer give you access to buildings.\n\nYou will not have access to systems that need a university login.\n\nYou should prepare for losing access to IT services (such as your email account). Follow the checklist on the\n\nLeaving the University\n\nwebpage.\n\nYou will no longer have access to\n\nStudent Support services.\n\nThis includes the Wellbeing Services.\n\nCareers Service\n\nYou can use our\n\nCareers Service\n\nfor up to three years after you leave, to help get where you want to be.\n\nExit award\n\nYou may be eligible for an exit award.

We recommend our\n\nUsing AI at University Study Skills training module\n\nto all students to help make the most of AI support in line with our academic integrity policy.\n\nDSAs \u00a3200 equipment contribution\n\nStudents contribute the first \u00a3200 towards DSAs-funded equipment. If this contribution would put them in financial hardship, signpost them to Disability Services.\n\nMeans-tested help may be available. Students whose family income is greater than \u00a342,875 will not receive help.\n\nPostgraduate Researchers and University of Bristol managed laptops\n\nPostgraduate research students are eligible for a University Managed Device to complete research and store data securely. Check that the student has a University Managed Device allocated or encourage them to approach their school.\n\nDue to using a University Of Bristol Managed Device only approved software can be installed and used with MFA set up on the software to meet Cyber Security Regulations.

The regulations can be found in section 3of the\n\nMobile and remote working policy\n\n.\n\nLecture capture (Re/Play)\n\nOur central lecture capture platform is called Re/Play.\n\nRe/Play recordings are subtitled using automatic captioning software.\n\nThese recordings can be:\n\nmanually captioned for improved accuracy for students who are hearing impaired\n\n'Authored', which means adding descriptions to images and figures to support visually impaired students.\n\nSignpost students who may need captioning or authoring to\n\nDisability Services\n\n.\n\nRe/Play is not available in all teaching venues and is not always used. We recommend that students are equipped with an alternative, DSAs-funded note-taking solution.\n\nAccess to buildings and facilities\n\nCheck\n\nUniversity of Bristol access guides on AccessAble\n\n.

Your SDC will have a copy of your study support plan.\n\nThese arrangements apply to exams organised by the Exams Office, scheduled during the\n\nuniversity assessment periods\n\n.\n\nExtra time\n\nExams\n\nThe amount of extra time you will have is recorded in your study support plan.\n\nInvigilators will be aware of your extra time provision and will keep track to ensure students are given the correct amount of additional time.\n\nStudents do not have to take the full amount of extra time if this is not required. However, please note that no student may leave the exam venue in the last 15 minutes of their scheduled exam duration.\n\nIf you have extra time you will not be in the main exam hall.\n\nIf you have other arrangements, such as rest breaks, or your study support plan specifies a smaller size venue, this will vary.\n\nIf your exam is online, your extra time will be added to the length of your exam.\n\nTimed assessments\n\nIf you have extra time, you will have one additional day to complete your timed assessment.\n\nThis means that a 3-day long timed assessment will become a 4-day long timed assessment, for example.\n\nYour school should tell you how much time you should spend on the exam, and you add your extra time to that amount. For example, if they said to spend 3 hours on the exam then, with 25% extra time, that would be 3 hours 45 min. With 50% extra time you should plan to spend 4.5 hours on the exam.\n\nComputer\n\nExams\n\nFor on-campus exams, you will be assigned a room with a with a computer, usually a desktop computer, which will appear in your timetable.\n\nYou will have a paper copy of the exam question booklet and you will have a paper transcript.

You will not have access to any other applications or software. You will not have access to the internet.\n\nIf you are permitted to use a calculator for the exam, you should bring an approved calculator with you (see\n\nWhat to take to the exam\n\nfor more information). You will not be able to use the calculator on the computer.\n\nFor some maths-based exams, you might not be timetabled into a computer room. Check with your School or the Exams Office if you are not sure whether you will have a computer for maths exams.\n\nIf your exam is online and remote, you will be expected to use your own computer.\n\nTimed assessments\n\nYou will be expected to use your own computer.\n\nYou are permitted to use any DSAs awarded assistive software for these assessments.\n\nRest breaks\n\nExams\n\nRest breaks are \u2018stop-the-clock\u2019 breaks. This means that the exam is paused while you take a break. The amount of time you will have, per hour, is recorded in your study support plan.\n\nYou should indicate to the invigilator when you are ready to take a break by raising your hand. If you are in a sole venue, you may indicate your breaks by speaking to the invigilator.\u00a0You do not need to take the whole time allocated for your break all at once. The invigilator will keep track of how much of your break you have used and adjust the end time of your exam accordingly.\n\nYou are not permitted to work during your rest break. If you take your break at your desk, the invigilator will remove your exam paper for the duration of the break.\n\nStudents may alternatively take their break outside the examination room and an invigilator will accompany you.\n\nIf you will need to use the toilet, take medicines or check your blood sugar during your break you may wish to alert the invigilator before the exam starts.\n\nIf you need to bring medical devices you should ensure that this is recorded on your study support plan.\n\nSmoking during breaks is not permitted.\n\nOnline exams\n\nIf your exam is online, your rest break allowance will be added to your total exam time. You will need to self-manage your breaks and take note of how much break time you have used.\n\nIf your exam is online and your department use proctoring software, you should announce the start and end of each break time out loud.\n\nYour should contact your School if you require more information on how proctoring software will be used.\n\nTimed assessments\n\nIf you have rest breaks, you will have one additional day to complete your timed assessment.\n\nThis means\u00a0that a 4-day long timed assessment will become a 5-day long timed assessment, for example.\n\nToilet breaks\n\nIf you will need regular toilet breaks due to a health condition or disability, or so that you can administer insulin or medicines in private, you should request stop-the-clock rest breaks in your study support plan. See information about rest breaks, above.\n\nAn invigilator will escort you to the toilet facilities.\n\nIf a student is taking a bathroom break, which is not part of a supervised rest break, then no additional time will be permitted to go to the bathroom.\n\nBringing items\n\nYou are permitted to bring anything that\n\nis already approved\n\n,\n\nsuch as water in an unlabelled, transparent bottle.\n\nIf you need to bring other items, such as back supports, cushions or ergonomic supports you should ensure that this is recorded in your study support plan. If it is not, please\n\ncontact Disability Services\n\nand request an updated study support plan.\n\nItems not listed in your study support plan (or not already permitted according to the Exam Regulations) may be in breach of\n\nexam rules\n\n.\n\nIf you need to bring medication to your exam, please ensure that you bring it in clear packaging. Any cardboard packaging, notes or information leaflets should be left in your bag.\n\nFood and drink\n\nWater is permitted. This should be in an unlabelled, transparent bottle.\n\nFood is only permitted if it has been requested as part of your study support plan (for example, if you are diabetic and need to manage your blood sugar).\n\nIt is recommended that the food is quiet to eat and unlabelled, such as fruit. You should avoid common allergens such as nuts and minimise disruption to other students.\n\nExam support workers: readers, scribes, prompters\n\nExams\n\nIf you have a reader, scribe or prompt, they will meet you at the examination venue. They will arrive 15 minutes before your exam.\n\nExam support workers will be guided by you. You may choose to use their support extensively, or only a little. They are there to support you.\n\nThey cannot make suggestions or proofread your work for you. Your work must still be your own.\n\nA reader can:\n\nread the exam questions aloud to you\n\nrepeat any questions, at your request, as many times as you need\n\nread sections of your own work aloud to you, at your request\n\nA reader cannot:\n\nreword or reinterpret the question for you\n\nprompt you with ideas for the content of your answers or correct your work\n\nA scribe can:\n\nwrite for you what you dictate to them, exactly as you dictate it\n\nwrite any punctuation that you stipulate\n\nread back what has been written, if requested, and make any changes you request\n\ndraw or add to diagrams, strictly in accordance with your instructions\n\nA scribe cannot:\n\nreword, reinterpret or proofread your work.\n\ncorrect your work.\n\nbe expected to know the spellings of specialist or technical terms. They will ask you how to spell any technical words.\n\nA prompter can:\n\nprompt you to move on if you are stuck on a question or appear to be focusing too much on one question and not moving on.\n\nprompt you to return to the exam if it appears that you have lost focus\n\ngive time prompts.\n\nWe may not always be able to provide exam support workers for online exams that you complete at home.\n\nStudents who have DSAs awarded software may sometimes be able to use this in an 'at home' exam:\n\ntext-to-speech software can be used in place of a Reader\n\ndictation (speech-to-text) software can be used in place of a scribe.\n\nuse of timers can help in the absence of a Prompter.\n\nYou should check with you school whether you will be permitted to use DSA funded software in your online/at home exam.\n\nIf you believe you will need a support worker and your exam is an online exam, please contact Disability Services.\n\nTimed assessments\n\nDue to the flexible nature of timed assessments (you choose when it is best for you to complete the exam) we are not usually able to provide exam support workers.\n\nStudents\u2019 who have DSAs awarded software may choose to use:\n\ntext-to-speech software can be used in place of a reader\n\ndictation (speech-to-text) software can be used in place of a scribe.\n\ntimers that can help in the absence of a prompter.\n\nIf you believe you will need a support worker and your exam is a timed assessment, contact Disability Services to discuss this."

These accounts are interest free, up to a specified limit, depending on your credit history. The bank may want evidence of your maintenance loan before you can open an account.\n\nYou may want to use online comparison tools to identify banks that offer the most generous interest-free overdraft facilities.\n\nStudent loans\n\nUndergraduate students\n\nThe UK government offers eligible undergraduate students a\n\ntuition fee loan and maintenance loan\n\nfor each year of study. The interest rates charged on these loans will depend on the\n\nloan plan\n\nthe student is on.\n\nPostgraduate students\n\nThe UK government offers loans to eligible taught and research postgraduate students.\u202fThese loans are a contribution towards tuition fees and/or living costs. Read more about\n\npostgraduate master's loans\n\nand\n\nPhD loans\n\n. The current interest rate charged on postgraduate loans can be viewed on the\n\nUK government website\n\n.\n\nPossible consequences of not taking out loans for studies\n\nIt is important to understand that if you decide for faith reasons not to take a loan for your studies, this may have an effect on your eligibility for other sources of funding. You would need to find alternative funding such as family, friends or savings to cover the cost of your education.\n\nSome factors you may wish to consider are:\n\nFinancial Assistance Fund\n\nThe University of Bristol has a\n\nFinancial assistance fund\n\nto help students facing financial hardship. If you are a home undergraduate student who is eligible for UK government Student Finance, you can only apply to the Financial Assistance Fund if you have taken your full maintenance loan entitlement.\n\nSimilarly, if you are a home postgraduate student, you must have made provision to pay your tuition fees and basic living costs and would be expected to have taken out the full loan you are eligible to receive from Student Finance before applying to the fund.\n\nIf you have not taken out the full loan from the UK Government due to religious reasons, you will still be able to apply to the Financial Assistance Fund if you are in hardship.\n\nUniversity of Bristol Bursary\n\nTo determine your eligibility for the University of Bristol Bursary, we will need confirmation of your household income, which is assessed by your regional government funding provider, eg Student Finance England. This means that you and your family must consent to be means-tested for the government loans, and provide details of your household income.\n\nYou may not ultimately wish to take out any loans that you are eligible to receive. However, unless you agree to be means-tested by your regional domiciled government funding provider, we cannot determine your household income. Consequently, we will not be able to determine if you are eligible for the main non-repayable University of Bristol Bursary.\n\nOther University bursaries and scholarships\n\nSeveral other University bursaries and scholarships, especially those designed to support students from a widening participation background, will use household income information to help determine who is eligible for the scholarship/bursary. Without information on your household income, your chances of being awarded one of these bursaries or scholarships may be reduced.\n\nWelfare benefits\n\nIf you are entitled to claim welfare benefits as a student, the office assessing your benefit claim will assume you have taken your UK government student finance loan entitlement and will reduce your benefit entitlement accordingly.\n\nOther UK government student finance\n\nSome elements of government Student Finance are not repayable and depend on your personal circumstances. These include supplementary grants for dependants or disability-related course costs. If you are assessed for support by Student Finance Wales you may qualify for a non-repayable maintenance grant. You might wish to discuss possible options with the Money Advice and Funding team.\n\nSharia-compliant financing\n\nThe UK government has been exploring the possibility of an alternative finance system available alongside traditional student loans that will avoid the payment of interest but results in identical repayments to the conventional system. This funding would be Sharia (Shariah, Shari\u2019 ah) compliant and overseen by a Sharia advisory committee.\n\nUpcoming Government funding changes mean that Student Finance England (SFE) will be introducing\n\nAlternative Student Finance\n\n. This will be part of Lifelong Learning Entitlement (LLE). It will be introduced from the academic year 2026/27.\n\nAs alternative student finance needs to mirror the LLE, SFE cannot introduce alternative student finance until this is in place. Alternative student finance will become available as soon as possible after the introduction of the LLE.\n\nSome financial institutions have Sharia-compliant financial services. They guarantee that money held in these accounts is not invested in industries such as gambling, alcohol or weapons manufacture.\n\nTrusts and charities\n\nIf you are a Muslim student, you may be eligible for some additional financial help from the National Zakat Foundation. Further information can be found\u00a0on\u202fthe\n\nNational Zakat Foundation\u202fwebsite\n\n."

If so, you should contact the\u202fMoney Advice and Funding Team. They can discuss possible financial support with you.\n\nWe offer\n\nemergency and hardship funds\n\nfor students who are experiencing financial difficulty.\n\nFinancial impact of suspending or withdrawing\n\nEligibility for student funding\n\nIf you are a home-fee-paying undergraduate student, studying your first degree. You are eligible for student funding for the\u202fduration of your course plus one year if you are:\n\na home-fee-paying undergraduate student\n\nand\n\nstudying your first degree.\n\nFor example, if you are studying a three-year BSc, you are entitled to four years of funding.\n\nSuspending or withdrawing can impact on your funding if you return to study.\n\nYou will receive full funding when you return to study if:\n\nYou haven not already used up your \"plus one\" year of funding\n\nand\n\nyou do not have any previous years of study before starting the course.\n\nIf you have used up your \"plus one\" year of funding , you would be eligible for a maintenance loan only when you return. You would be eligible not a tuition fee loan.\n\nRepaying tuition fees and maintenance loan\n\nYour student finance provider will adjust your entitlement based on your last attendance date. They will work out any overpayment you may have received. They will then contact you to discuss repayment.\n\nIf you do not repay, they will deduct your overpayment from the funding you are due to receive in future years. The Money Advice and Funding Team can help you complete an SFE Hardship Fund form. This overpayment will then be moved from year to year.\n\nWhen you suspend or withdraw, your tuition fee liability will be worked out again using your last attendance date. This table applies to most undergraduate courses at the university. Be aware that some students will be subject to a different refund policy. Students studying for a PGCE should refer to their school policy.\n\nYour last date of attendance\n\n% of tuition fee liability\n\n% of tuition fee refunded\n\nFirst two weeks of 1st term\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\nThird week of 1st term\u202fto before start\u202fof 2nd term\n\n25%\n\n75%\n\nOn or after start of 2nd term to before start of 3rd term\n\n50%\n\n50%\n\nOn or after start of 3rd term\n\n100%\n\n0%\n\nHow to suspend or withdraw from your studies\n\nYou should read our full guidance on\n\nwithdrawing from\n\nor\n\nsuspending your studies\n\n.\n\nOnce we have confirmed your suspension or withdrawal, we will inform your student finance provider of your last day of attendance. The student finance provider usually takes around six weeks to process this change of circumstances. After this point, they will get in touch with you about any overpayments you have received. This includes any maintenance loan payment you have received that covers beyond your last date of attendance. You may also receive your next maintenance loan instalment during these six weeks. In this case you will need to repay in full.\n\nYou can keep 60 days\u2019 worth of overpayment of maintenance loan if your suspension is due to:\n\nill health\n\npregnancy.\n\nThese 60 days are counted from your last day of attendance.\n\nReturning to study\n\nYou should apply for student finance as early as possible before you return to study to avoid delays.\n\nWhen you return after a suspension, the tuition fee loan will usually be calculated on a pro-rata basis. You should get the full maintenance loan. This is because you will remain on a full-time course code, even if you are studying as a part-time variable student. Do not apply for part-time student finance funding. If you are registered part-time on your supplementary year, apply for full-time funding as normal.\n\nThink ahead about where you will live on your return. If you are struggling financially on your return to study, you may wish to apply to the\n\nFinancial Assistance Fund\n\n."

        "content": "Intercalation funding\n\nAn intercalated degree gives you the opportunity to achieve another degree (usually a BSc or BA) during your course. The funding available varies depending on whether you're intercalating on to an undergraduate or postgraduate course.\n\nIntercalating on to an undergraduate course\n\nStudying medicine or dentistry as your first undergraduate degree\n\nIf you intercalate after the third year of your medicine/dentistry programme, or earlier, you will receive living cost and tuition fee funding for your intercalation year from Student Finance or the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.\n\nIf you intercalate after the fourth year and normally live in England or Wales, the NHS will provide a non-means tested grant of \u00a31,020 (2024/25 figures). Some students may also be eligible for a means-tested bursary from the NHS. Your household income will affect the amount of NHS bursary you can receive. You will also be eligible for a reduced-rate non-means tested loan for living costs from the Student Loans Company.\n\nIf you are from Northern Ireland, and intercalate after the third year of medicine/dentistry, you may be eligible for a Department of Health Bursary. This will depend on your household income. You will also be eligible for a reduced-rate non-means tested loan for living costs from the Student Loans Company.\n\nIf you intercalate after the fourth year, and normally live in Scotland, you will receive living cost and tuition fee funding from\u00a0the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. You will receive this in the usual way throughout your course, including the intercalation year.\n\nStudying medicine or dentistry as your second undergraduate degree\n\nIf you are studying medicine or dentistry as your second undergraduate degree, you will have to pay tuition fees yourself for your intercalation year. There is no maintenance loan payable for your intercalation year.\u00a0If you intercalate after your fourth year of study, you will be eligible for a reduced rate non-means tested maintenance loan.\n\nStudying veterinary science as your first undergraduate degree\n\nYou will receive living cost and tuition fee funding from Student Finance or the Student Awards Agency for Scotland for the whole of your course, including the intercalation year.\n\nStudying veterinary science as your second undergraduate degree\n\nStudents studying a second undergraduate degree will have to pay the tuition fees themselves for the intercalation year. There is no maintenance loan payable for your intercalation year.\n\nHelp with student finance applications\n\nSometimes students experience issues with their funding after intercalating. For that reason we recommend you use the PR1 paper form to apply to Student Finance. We provide a letter for you to include that explains the intercalation process.\n\n1. Download and print the intercalation letter to send with your student finance application:\n\n2025/26\n\nIntercalation letter for vet science 2025/26 (PDF, 105kB)\n\nIntercalation letter for dentistry 2025/26 (PDF, 103kB)\n\nIntercalation letter for medicine 2025/26 (PDF, 106kB)\n\n2. You should apply using the paper PR1 form and you can access the\n\nform and guidance from the GOV.UK website\n\n.\n\nIntercalating on to a postgraduate degree\n\nStudents who intercalate on to a postgraduate degree can apply for a\n\npostgraduate master's loan\n\nfor the intercalation year. You will also be eligible to apply for Disabled Students\u2019 Allowances, if required.\n\nHowever, it is essential that your postgraduate award certificate is not conferred until after you have completed your undergraduate degree. You must get confirmation from the awarding institution that they are prepared to delay your graduation for the postgraduate award. We advise that you do this\u00a0before\u00a0you start your intercalating course.\n\nIf you do receive a postgraduate award certificate, you will\n\nnot\n\nbe eligible for any tuition fee loans when you return to your undergraduate course. If this happens, you will be liable to pay your tuition fees yourself for the remainder of your undergraduate course."

In addition, if you are receiving funding from any of the following schemes,\n\nyou would\u00a0not\u00a0be eligible to receive additional funding\n\n:\n\nSanctuary Scholarship\n\nVice-Chancellor's Scholarship\n\nYou may apply for additional funding and one of the above schemes with the understanding that\n\nyou can only receive funding from one of these\n\n.\n\nThere may be rare occasions where schemes are processed in parallel, meaning that a few students are offered multiple awards. On such occasions, it is your responsibility to inform the\n\nScholarships and Bursaries Team\n\nto check for compatibility of multiple awards. The University will also run eligibility checks throughout the year to ensure a fair distribution of the awards.\n\nOn these rare occasions where you are offered multiple additional awards, you may be asked to choose which scheme you prefer to receive or the University may decide based on a number of factors (such as the size of the reserve list). On such occasions, there will not be the option to receive both awards. If there has been an overpayment of funding, these overpayments will be recovered for redistribution.\n\nThe University's decision will take into account the needs of the entire student body and as such, will be final with no appeal process.\n\nNote: if you repeat a year, your funding is withheld until you progress to the next course block.\n\nAwards\n\nThere are a number of bursaries and scholarships available each year for first-year Home (UK) undergraduate students. Some of these schemes have specific criteria relating to the course of study while others are open to students from any discipline. Most awards are made in the form of a payment to the student, however, some schemes are fee waivers.\n\nThese are usually awarded to students from low-income backgrounds, as assessed by household income data provided by the Student Loans Company via its regional funding providers. Normally, recipients will also be eligible to receive the University of Bristol Bursary, which is why these schemes are known as\n\nadditional\n\nfunding.\n\nThe value of awards to successful candidates will vary depending on the scheme.\n\nPayments are likely to be made in two instalments, one in November and one in February.\u00a0Details of the payment dates will be provided after registration.\n\nThis application process includes these bursaries and scholarships. We will update these bursaries and scholarships for 2026/27:\n\nFutures scholarship\n\nBlack Futures scholarship\n\nBoeing Futures scholarship\n\nThe GF scholarship\n\nThe Geraldine Keefe Women in Engineering Futures scholarship\n\nCratchley scholarship in History\n\nQube Research and Technology scholarship\n\nLady Ryder Medical scholarship\n\nAnne and Peggy Sleigh bursaries\n\nThe Nicholls Arts bursary\n\nEileen Drummond and Sheila Anderson Law bursary\n\nChristopher Frederick Edwards Bursary\n\nThis list will be revised on an annual basis and no scheme is guaranteed to run every year.\n\nThe University also operates a Financial Assistance Fund and several hardship funds. If you receive additional funding, you are eligible to apply for these hardship funds. However, the amount of additional funding you're receiving would be taken into account during the assessment process for any of these other discretionary awards.\n\nHow to apply\n\nThe online application form will open in term one on the\n\nadditional funding page\n\n.\n\nAll applications should be received by the published deadline. The online application form will close once the deadline passes. There is no appeals process and requests to submit late applications will not be considered.\n\nAssessment process\n\nApplications will be assessed and matched to available schemes according to the best fit.\n\nStudents eligible for subject-specific schemes will be matched first.\n\nAll other applications will be matched to the remaining funds.\n\nInformation provided in the application and other information provided with your UCAS application will be used to determine which applicants display the most demonstrable need.\n\nThe University will make offers of an award to successful candidates.\n\nFull details of the scheme being offered, including the terms and conditions, will be made available.\n\nIf you are offered an award, you will be asked to accept the relevant terms and conditions.\n\nYou will need to firmly accept your offer of a place to remain eligible for the award.\n\nTo ensure that all available funding is distributed, the University will select a number of students to be on a reserve list. Students on the reserve list may be contacted at a later date to be informed that they have been offered an award should funding become available. Being placed on the reserve list is not a guarantee of an award.\n\nOther criteria\n\nTo receive a payment, you should:\n\nbe registered at the University, engaged with your studies, and have a good attendance record\n\nbe eligible for and have applied for means-tested financial support in the form of the tuition fee and living costs loans from the Student Loans Company\n\nhave provided your (and your parents' pr guardians') consent to the Student Loans Company, via their regional funding provider, to share your household income data with the University.\n\nThe University reserves the right to allocate any payments of the award to any outstanding invoices if you have missed payments due to the University (for example for accommodation). This is in accordance with the University\u2019s regulations.\n\nTimetable\n\nThe timetable for this scholarship can be found on the\n\nadditional funding page\n\n."

The awards offer support to law students in need of financial aid.\n\nFor Sheila Anderson, law, justice and access to education were more than just a passion, they were at the core of who she was. Her life-changing legacy donation to the University of Bristol equals more than \u00a31.5 million.\n\nSheila graduated from Bristol in 1956, and went on to pursue a successful career in law, working both as a barrister and in-house lawyer throughout her life. This might not have been possible if Sheila had not been awarded a state scholarship from the government, which paid for her fees and living expenses at university. Receiving this support played an important part in Sheila pledging \u00a31.5 million to create a permanent scholarship fund that will support law students at Bristol.\n\nSheila said: \"I much enjoyed my time there. I wish to give others, who may otherwise be unable to afford it, the opportunity to study Law at the University.\"\n\nFollowing her death in 2013, Sheila's gift has been used to establish a permanent scholarship fund for law students, and\u00a0the first awards were presented to five first-year students in 2015.\n\nSheila was keen that this fund acknowledged her family name, hence the inclusion of her mother\u2019s name Eileen Drummond."

Any decision will be final and cannot be appealed.\n\nIf you are awarded a Sanctuary Scholarship and are subject to immigration control, your acceptance of the scholarship will give consent for the University of Bristol to conduct a right to study check at the start of each term. The University of Bristol will seek your consent for any additional check that is required.\n\nChange in circumstances\n\nWithdrawing from your course\n\nAfter you have withdrawn from your studies, you will not be eligible for any further Sanctuary Scholarship payments.\n\nYou will not have to repay any Sanctuary Scholarship instalments previously paid to you while you were registered and in attendance on the date of the payment.\n\nIf you withdraw, and your Sanctuary Scholarship was covering your tuition fees, your Sanctuary Scholarship tuition fee award will be adjusted to meet any adjusted tuition fee liability.\n\nTransferring to a different course at the University\n\nYour Sanctuary Scholarship only covers your original chosen course.\n\nIf you transfer to another course at the University of Bristol, you will normally be entitled to the Sanctuary Scholarship award equivalent to the duration of your original degree, less any years worth of support already paid.\n\nIf you are considering transferring course, you must inform the Student Funding Office\n\nbefore\n\nany change is finalised with your faculty to discuss the implication on your Sanctuary Scholarship funding.\n\nIf you transfer course\n\nafter\u00a0the scholarship has been awarded, any additional funding that may be needed to cover additional living costs and tuition fees as a result of this course change will only be paid at the discretion of the Student Funding Office and is not guaranteed.\n\nIf after having been notified of your Sanctuary Scholarship award, you transfer to a course that is longer in duration than your original course (eg from a BSc to an MSci, or to a course with a year in industry), you are not guaranteed funding for your additional year.\n\nIf you transfer to a course with a higher tuition fee than your original course, you may be liable to pay the difference between the two tuition fees yourself.\n\nIf you transfer to a University-affiliated college, you will no longer be eligible for the Sanctuary Scholarship.\n\nTransferring to a different university\n\nThe University of Bristol Sanctuary Scholarship is non transferable.\n\nIf you transfer to a different university, your Sanctuary Scholarship payments will cease when your University of Bristol course registration ends.\n\nRepeating studies\n\nSanctuary Scholarship funding may not be available for any period of repeat study.\n\nYou may need to be able to fund any period of repeat study yourself, including tuition fees and living costs.\n\nIf you are eligible for government funding, you may be eligible for some continued support during your period of repeat study. This is a complex area, so you should contact the Student Funding Office for advice.\n\nIf during the period of repeat study your scholarship entitlement is put on hold, it will restart once you have successfully completed the period of repeat study and satisfactorily progressed on your studies.\n\nSuspending your studies\n\nIf you are considering suspending your studies, you must inform the Student Funding Office before any change is finalised with your faculty.\n\nIf you have agreement from your faculty to temporarily suspend your studies, you may not be entitled to receive Sanctuary Scholarship award payments during the period of suspension. Your scholarship entitlement during any suspension period is at the discretion of the Student Funding Office. The Student Funding Office will take into account government restrictions on your ability to work, access to other government or University funding support and the intensity of study for the period of suspension.\n\nYou must inform the Student Funding Office of any suspension at the earliest opportunity to avoid being overpaid.\n\nThe University of Bristol reserves the right to seek repayment of any scholarship overpayment you receive, where it is caused by your failure to inform the Student Funding Office of the change to your registration status in a timely manner.\n\nChanging from studying full-time to part-time\n\nIf you are considering changing from full-time study to part-time study during your studies, you must inform the Student Funding Office before any change is finalised with your faculty.\n\nIf you have agreement from your faculty to temporarily change to from a full-time to a part-time mode of attendance, you may not be entitled to receive Sanctuary Scholarship award payments during your extended study period.\n\nYour scholarship entitlement during any period of extended study is at the discretion of the Student Funding Office.\n\nChange in immigration status during studies\n\nIf you receive any change to your immigration status you\n\nmust\n\ninform the Student Funding Office immediately.\n\nThis would include any response \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 from the Home Office to an application you have made, as well as any further immigration applications submitted, notification of changes to status or the terms associated with your granted status.\n\nAny communication from or to the Home Office regarding your status and its terms should be brought to the attention of the Student Funding Office so your continued right to study can be confirmed.\n\nIf a change in your immigration status means that you become eligible for UK government student financial support, you must apply for this support without delay. Once you have informed the Student Funding Office of this change to your immigration status, a University student funding adviser will be able to help you apply for this support. You would then be expected to re-apply for UK government student financial support in each subsequent year, should you remain eligible.\n\nOnce your UK government student financial support has been assessed and awarded, your Sanctuary Scholarship entitlement will be reassessed to take into account any government student funding you are now eligible to receive.\n\nChange in nationality status\n\nYou must inform the Student Funding Office if your nationality status changes at any point during your application or studies.\n\nYour fee status and student support may be affected by any change in nationality."

        "content": "University of Bristol Bursary: FAQs\n\nHow do I know if I am eligible for a bursary?\n\nHome UK students on undergraduate programmes, who receive a government maintenance (or special support) grant and whose household income is \u00a350,000 or below will be eligible for a University of Bristol Bursary.\n\nHow much is it worth?\n\nA range of bursary amounts will apply between these qualifying household income levels for 2025/26, as shown in this table:\n\nHousehold income\n\nBursary entitlement (full-time students)\n\n\u00a310,000 or below\n\n\u00a32,500\n\n\u00a310,001 to \u00a320,000\n\n\u00a32,000\n\n\u00a320,001 to \u00a330,000\n\n\u00a31,500\n\n\u00a330,001 to \u00a340,000\n\n\u00a31,000\n\n\u00a340,001 to \u00a350,000\n\n\u00a3500\n\nBursaries for eligible part-time students will be calculated based on the tuition fee you pay. For example, if your part-time fee is 30% of the full-time fee, your bursary will be 30% of the equivalent full-time bursary.\n\nIs there a deadline date to claim my University of Bristol Bursary?\n\nYes. You must have claimed your University of Bristol Bursary by the last day of the summer term for each academic year.\n\nHow do I get means tested, so you know my household income?\n\nYou need to apply to your regional Student Finance provider and request to be assessed for means-tested student finance. They will ask you for details of your household income and check the figures provided by your parents/sponsors. You are automatically opted in to allowing your Student Finance provider to share your household income with us.\n\nWho is my regional Student Finance provider?\n\nThat will depend on where you normally live when not at University.\n\nThe relevant websites for applying for support are:\n\nEnglish students:\n\nStudent Finance England\n\nWelsh students:\n\nStudent Finance Wales\n\nNorthern Irish students:\n\nStudent Finance Northern Ireland\n\nScottish students:\n\nStudent Awards Agency for Scotland\n\nDo I need to complete a separate application form to apply for the bursary?\n\nNo. Your regional provider will assess your entitlement to means tested support using details of your household income provided on your application for student funding. They will pass this information to the Student Loans Company.\n\nIf you and your parents/sponsors have given your consent to share this information, the Student Loans Company will then confirm your household income with the University of Bristol.\n\nDo I need to give my consent to share this information?\n\nYes. However, you are automatically opted in when you apply for government funding.\n\nI originally opted out of giving my consent (or my parents/sponsors did), is it too late to give consent now?\n\nNo, it isn't too late, but you and your parent/sponsor must call the appropriate number. Consent can be given at any time during the year.\n\nEnglish students: 0300 100 0607\n\nWelsh students: 0300 200 4050\n\nNorthern Irish students: 0300 100 0077\n\nScottish students: 0300 555 0505\n\nWhat will happen once the University of Bristol receives details of my household income from the Student Loans Company?\n\nYou will be emailed as soon as possible in the first few weeks of term to confirm your bursary award. Your notification of award will be delayed if you were late:\n\napplying for statutory support\n\ngiving your consent to share information\n\nCan I provide my household income through other means?\n\nNo, we can only accept this information via your student finance provider.\n\nI don\u2019t want to take out a government loan, can I still get the bursary?\n\nEven if you don't want to take out a loan, we require that you are means-tested by your Regional Funding Provider. To do this, you must apply for a loan as normal and then request that the amount is changed to \u00a30.\n\nIf you need help, email\n\nmoney-advice@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nHow will the bursary be paid?\n\nThe bursary will be paid directly into your bank account by BACS payment.\n\nHow do I give the University of Bristol my bank details?\n\nOnce you have arrived and registered with the University, you will need to supply your bank account details\n\nin eVision\n\n.\n\nFind instructions on\n\nentering your bank details\n\n.\n\nWhen will I receive payment of my University of Bristol Bursary?\n\nThe bursary will be paid in three instalments provided you are still registered on your course at the time of payment.\n\nI am studying medicine/dentistry. If I decide to intercalate as part of my programme, how will my bursary entitlement be affected?\n\nIf you decide to intercalate, your NHS funding will start earlier in your programme. This means your University of Bristol bursary entitlement will also stop earlier.\n\nFor further information, read our advice on\n\nintercalation for students on NHS funded programmes\n\n.\n\nIf my household income is less than \u00a350,000 and I only give my consent to share part way through the academic year, will this affect payment of my University of Bristol Bursary?\n\nIf we receive your household information before the last day of the academic year, you shall receive the bursary and be back-paid any payments you may have missed that academic year. Payments from previous academic years will not be back-paid.\n\nMy first year is about to start and I have not yet applied for statutory support from my regional provider. How can I find out if I might qualify for a means-tested support, and is it too late to apply?\n\nYou can apply for statutory support up to nine months after the start of your academic year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nStudents from Scotland only have until the end of March in any given academic year to apply for support. So students in the 2025/26 academic year must apply by the end of March 2026 for financial support applicable to that academic year.\n\nHowever, each year you should apply as early as possible to make sure that your funding is in place for the start of the academic year.\n\nWill a late application to my Regional Funding Provider for statutory support affect my entitlement for a bursary from the University of Bristol?\n\nNo. Provided your household income is \u00a350,000 or less and you give your consent for the Student Loans Company to share this information, the University of Bristol will still pay you a bursary. However, your payments will be delayed, so apply as soon as you can.\n\nWhat happens if I supply you with the incorrect bank details?\n\nMake sure that you supply an accurate bank account number and sort code in the first instance. If you supply incorrect bank details or change banks without updating us, your bursary payment will fail.\n\nAll payments are made via BACS, therefore we will not be able to make payments to students until they have provided correct bank details.\n\nCan I receive my bursary earlier?\n\nNo, we cannot expedite bursary payments. If you are concerned about financing your studies, please have a look at our\n\nmoney advice web page\n\n.\n\nI\u2019m receiving the maximum government loan, why am I not receiving the maximum bursary?\n\nThe maintenance loan bands and our award bands are different. Either may be changed independently from the other.\n\nWhy is my award less than I expected?\n\nYour award may be less than you expected because:\n\nyour household income is higher than you think it is. We are not able to share this information with you due to GDPR, but it is often the case.\n\nyour Regional Funding Provider has not correctly assessed your household income. In this instance, you will need to reach out to them and request reassessment. Our\n\nMoney Advisers\n\ncan help with this.\n\nyou are studying part-time. If so, you shall receive the percentage of your award that matches the percentage of fees you are paying. If you pay 30% of the fee rate, you shall receive 30% of your award band. In this example, if your household income was between \u00a310,001 and \u00a320,000, you would receive 30% of \u00a32,000 which would be rounded up to \u00a3666.67.\n\nFor further advice, please contact\n\nscholarships-bursaries@bristol.ac.uk\n\n."

Not all recipients will be informed at the same time.\n\nYou are required to provide the University with your bank details to ensure timely bursary payments directly into your account using the BACS process. Follow these\n\ninstructions to enter your bank details\n\n.\n\nAll payments are made via BACS, therefore we will not be able to make payments to students until they have provided their bank details.\n\nPayments will be made in three instalments.\n\nOther criteria\n\nYou are required to inform Money Advice and Funding if there is a change to your household income that will affect your bursary entitlement.\n\nIn the case where the amount you are to receive moves from a higher to a lower band, the University will not normally reclaim any overpayment. Any outstanding payments during the remaining academic year will be adjusted to the new bursary level.\n\nHowever, if you have already received more than the total value of the partial bursary from your previous instalments, no further payments will be made for that academic year.\n\nIf you suspend or withdraw from your studies, you will not have to repay any bursary payment. If you are in attendance on the date that bursary payments are made, you will receive your bursary instalment. If you suspend or withdraw, you shall be invoiced for any payments received after your suspension or withdrawal date. Payments received before that date will not be reclaimed.\n\nIf you repeat a year you will not automatically be entitled to repeat bursary funding."

The loan fee is taken off each payment you receive. This means the money you receive will be less than what you actually borrow.\n\nYou must still repay the whole amount borrowed, not only what you received. Loan fees change each year.\n\nThe interest rate\n\nvaries depending on your loan type and the first payment date of your loan. Interest rates change each year from 1 July.\n\nReceiving your loan\n\nYou will not receive the first loan payment until you have\n\nregistered with us\n\n. Make sure you have personal funds to cover your living costs for up to the first four weeks.\n\nPayment dates\n\nThere will be two equal payments if you are an undergraduate student:\n\nPayment 1: October\n\nPayment 2: January.\n\nThere will be three equal payments if you are a postgraduate taught student:\n\nPayment 1: October\n\nPayment 2: January\n\nPayment 3: May.\n\nThere will be two equal payments if you are a postgraduate research student:\n\nPayment 1: October\n\nPayment 2: March.\n\nThe actual amount of each payment in GBP(\u00a3) will depend on the exchange rate for USD($) to GBP(\u00a3) on that date. Your loan will also come with\n\na loan fee\n\n.\n\nYou will not need to pay tuition and accommodation fees on the set\n\nfee payment dates\n\n. We will set your tuition and accommodation fee payment dates to match your USFL dates.\n\nThe money we take away from your loan to cover your tuition and accommodation fees will be in GBP(\u00a3). We will pay the remaining loan amount to your bank account in USD($) on each payment date. We cannot know or guarantee the exchange rate used at the point of each payment.\n\nYou need a UK bank account to receive your loan. Our page on\n\nopening a UK bank account\n\nhas information about how to set one up.\n\nDeadline dates\n\nYou should submit your application by 31 August before the academic year your studies start. We might not approve late applications in time for the standard first payment date.

We must do this through the\n\nNational Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)\n\nevery 60 days. Reporting you as full or half-time will defer any USFLs taken out before you started your studies.\n\nIf you are not taking out USFLs during your study, but want to defer previous US Loans, email\n\nus-loans@bris.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nNSLDS have reported statuses which they must record. These statuses are for NSLDS only and are separate to our own regulations:\n\nfull time students: 'Full time' (F)\n\npart time students (studying between 100% and 50% part time): 'Half time' (H)\n\nstudents studying part time less than 50% or by distance learning: 'Less than half time' (L)\n\nstudents who suspend or withdraw from studies: 'Withdrawn' (W)\n\nwhen a student returns from suspension: 'Full time' (F) or 'Half time' (H)\n\nPGR students who have approved leave for less than 180 days: 'Approved leave of absence' (A)\n\nan approved leave of absence for more than 180 days: 'Withdrawn' (W)\n\nstudents who have completed their studies:\n\nundergraduate and PGT: 'Less than half time' (L)\n\nPGR students who have submitted a thesis: 'Less than half time' (L)\n\nwhen we confirm a student has graduated on our database: 'Graduated' (G)\n\nif the student needs to make corrections: 'Full time' (F) or 'Half time' (H)\n\nsee the\n\nNSLDS reporting policy (Office document, 69kB)\n\nfor how a reported status affects your loan repayments and grace periods.\n\nExit counselling\n\nTowards the end of your studies, you must\n\ncomplete exit counselling\n\n. This is to make sure you are prepared for repayment.\n\nThis applies for each type of USFL borrowed. It is a condition of your loan terms. You must also complete exist counselling if you:\n\nreduce your study hours to under half time\n\nwithdraw from your studies.\n\nWe will email you to remind you to complete exit counselling.\n\nYou can complete exit counselling on the\n\nstudent loans website\n\n.\n\nYou must complete a form updating us on your contact details when you leave the University. The contact details for the referees listed\n\non your MPNs\n\nwill also need to be updated at that time. The US Loans team will email you this form as you are nearing the end of your studies.\n\nSatisfactory academic progress\n\nTo stay eligible for USFLs, you must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP).\n\nSAP policy for undergraduate and postgraduate taught students (Office document, 215kB)\n\nSAP policy for postgraduate research students (Office document, 209kB)\n\nFor questions about SAP, contact the US Loans team at\n\nus-loans@bristol.ac.uk\n\nAt time of writing, this policy is as accurate to ED guidelines. We can update this policy in line with changes made by the ED at any time.\n\nChanging your study\u00a0status\n\nUnder US federal law, we must report any changes to your study status to the US Department of Education (ED) as soon as possible.\n\nInforming us\n\nYou tell us if your study status changes by emailing\n\nus-loans@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.

This would set out the return of any 'unearned' funds to the ED.\n\nR2T4 Calculation\n\nIf you withdraw from your studies, the US Loans team will complete\n\nan R2T4 calculation\n\n. They use a formula from the ED to decide \"earned\" and \"unearned\" amounts.\n\nIf they calculate that you have completed\u00a0more than 60% of your payment period, no funds are due for return.\n\nIf they calculate that you have completed less than 60% of your payment period, some funds could be due for return.\n\nAny funds received after we take off your tuition fees are not to be repaid immediately. They will be repaid as outlined\n\nin your MPN\n\n.\n\nYou might withdraw from your studies before you have received any USFL funds.\n\nIn this case, we will calculate amount you have earned, and release it to you.\n\nWithdraw requirements for Title IV programme are separate from\n\nour own refund policy\n\n. You may still owe funds to us to cover unpaid charges. We will also attempt to collect any Title IV programme funds from you that the ED needs us to return.\n\nWe decide official withdrawal dates by use of:\n\na completed withdrawal form\n\nan agreement between the school and the student.\n\nFor unofficial withdrawal, we use the date we become aware that you stopped attending.\n\nReturn of unearned funds should be no later than 45 days after we decide the withdrawal date. If refunded money must go to the aid programme, funds will be returned in the following order:\n\nunsubsidised loans\n\nsubsidised loans\n\nPLUS loans.\n\nThe US Loans team will email you with:\n\nthe amount that we need to return to the US Federal aid programme\n\nthe amount (if any) we need to payor refund you.\n\nMore information about the R2T4 process can be found in our\n\nR2T4 policy (Office document, 60kB)\n\n.\n\nChanging your loan amount\n\nIt could be possible to increase, decrease, or cancel your loan amount during the academic year.\n\nIncreasing your loan\n\nIf you want to increase your loan during the academic year, email\n\nus-loans@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.

        "category": "Money & Fees",
        "content": "How your fees are spent\n\nThe University is funded from a wide range of sources and uses this funding entirely to support its research and teaching activities.\n\nFor the University to be sustainable in the long-term, it needs to generate surpluses in order to fund the cost of major investments in the University that benefit students, e.g.\n\nTemple Quarter Enterpise Campus\n\nand investment in digital infrastructure.\n\nWe spend the income from tuition fees in ways that we believe will best enable us to deliver a world class education and support the future prospects of all our students. The table shows how the University utilises an average taught programme tuition fee. This may vary across courses and faculties, as described further below.\n\nCategory\n\n23/24 Home UG breakdown\n\nTeaching and assessment\n\nIncluding staff time (includes research that informs teaching), timetabling, providing online resources, exam set up, personal tutor time\n\n26%\n\nSupport staff in schools\n\nIncluding administrative and technical staff\n\n9%\n\nNon-staff costs of running schools\n\nIncluding equipment and consumables to support teaching, academic staff training and travel and student recruitment costs\n\n8%\n\nCore student support services (staff costs)\n\nProfessional services divisions staff costs (e.g. Human Resources, Finance)\n\n14%\n\nCore student support services (non-staff costs)\n\nIncluding library books, Careers events, and Sport and health services\n\n9%\n\nWidening Access to Bristol\n\nWorking with thousands of potential new students to raise awareness and aspirations to higher education,\n\nengaging a range from primary school children to adult learners returning to education\n\n7%\n\nMaintenance and building running costs\n\nIncluding lighting, heating and maintenance costs\n\n16%\n\nProvision of IT, equipment and buildings\n\nIncluding staff IT equipment, shared computers, wifi, and network costs\n\nThis does not include student accommodation which is run on a neutral basis i.e rent covers all costs in normal year of operation\n\n11%\n\nTotal\n\n100%\n\nSubject/school variations\n\nMany factors contribute to the cost of educating an individual university student. For taught students numbers of lectures, labs and seminars across the University do vary significantly because of the different ways in which students can become proficient in their disciplinary areas. Research students have very different needs in relation to access to laboratories, libraries and collections.\n\nIndividual students also have very different needs and approaches to their studies: some make far heavier use of welfare services, others of sports facilities.\n\nWe aim to cater for the needs of all students, and we clearly cannot put an individual price on each student\u2019s degree. There is inevitably, therefore, some level of cross-subsidy between students. But we aim to use all of our resources to support our educational and research activities as effectively and fairly as possible.\n\nInternational students\n\nThe University receives no Office for Students funding for international students and so their tuition fees have to cover the full cost of their education. It is more costly for the University to recruit international students and there are some additional regulatory requirements for the University that add to our costs.\n\nThe University sets fees for international students to reflect these differences and based on the strong demand for our courses from overseas students.\n\nUndergraduate vs postgraduate teaching\n\nThe cost of teaching postgraduate students may be higher than the cost of teaching undergraduates. Postgraduates are taught for a longer academic year than undergraduates, and staff and other costs may therefore be higher.\n\nWe base our fee levels for postgraduates on the cost of delivery of our educational provision, and in accordance with what we believe to be the value of the educational experience at Bristol.\n\nDo tuition fees subsidise research?\n\nAlthough most research is directly funded by external funders such as Research Councils, industrial partners or other government sources, the full cost of research projects is not usually covered by these grants. A lot of our expenditure covers activities, infrastructure or staff that support both teaching and research. Most of our academic staff do research and teaching, both of which add value to our students\u2019 learning experience. Many of our facilities, including laboratories, are used for both research and teaching.\n\nThere is inevitably some cross-subsidy for research from teaching income. However, all our students benefit enormously from the world-leading academics that we employ and from the cutting-edge research that they undertake, both in terms of how it informs the curriculum and of the support that students get for their research (whether at undergraduate or postgraduate level). Undergraduates also benefit from the strong culture of postgraduate researchers at Bristol and their support of undergraduate education.\n\nTemple Quarter Enterprise Campus (TQEC)\n\nThe investment in TQEC is a key priority in the medium term to enable our future academic, environmental and financial sustainability. The financing of this project is supported from several sources including a bank loan taken out in 2017, but also from external sources of funding such as Governmental grants and philanthropic donations.\n\nExpectations for future funding and costs for this project as well as assessments of the risks and mitigations are happening and will continue before making final decisions to proceed with the campus build. It is still expected in the long term that TQEC will create a return that will pay off the loan and return cash to the University for further use.\n\nUniversity funding and expenditure\n\nThis table represents the income that the University received in 2023/24, broken down by category.\n\n2023/24 funding sources\n\nCategory\n\nAmount\n\nTuition fees and education contracts\n\n\u00a3459.9 million\n\nResearch grants and contracts\n\n\u00a3298.3 million\n\nInvestment income and endowment donations\n\n\u00a325.6 million\n\nOther grant income\n\n\u00a315.2 million\n\nCapital grant income\n\n\u00a321.7 million\n\nRecurrent research grant (Research England)\n\n\u00a358.0 million\n\nRecurrent teaching grant (OfS)\n\n\u00a336.8 million\n\nOther income\n\n\u00a337.6 million\n\nResidences, catering and conferences*\n\n\u00a373.2 million\n\nTotal\n\n\u00a31,091.8 million\n\n*The student residences are intended to be self-sustaining financially. The income generated from student rents, conferences and so on covers the cost of maintaining the estate and providing residential services, in addition to funding future investment.\n\nOur expenditure\n\nWe aim to use the funds available to us to support world-changing research, high-quality research-informed teaching, a first-class student experience, a vibrant and inspirational academic community, and outstanding academic and student facilities that help to make a University of Bristol education one of the very best in the UK.\n\nThe University employs almost 9,000 staff, of which 42% are academic staff and 58% are professional and technical services staff. These members of staff teach and support over 30,000 registered students.\n\nOther operating costs include a wide range of activities including the maintenance and operation of buildings and equipment, libraries, computers and student services. For example, the Careers Service offers guidance and information to our students and graduates and provides ways for students and potential employers to meet through recruitment fairs and presentations. Welfare Services, including Disability Services, Multi-faith Chaplaincy, Student Counselling and the Students\u2019 Health Service provide personal, confidential support to help you manage your studies and get the best out of the University experience.\n\nThis table represents the expenditure that the University spent in 2023/24, broken down by category.\n\n2023/24 expenditure\n\nCategory\n\nAmount\n\nResearch grants\n\n\u00a3130.6 million\n\nPremises\n\n\u00a338.6 million\n\nAdministration\n\n\u00a325.3 million\n\nResidences, catering and conferences\n\n\u00a353.7 million\n\nFinancing costs\n\n\u00a330.9 million\n\nAcademic and related expenditure\n\n\u00a3140.6 million\n\nStaff costs\n\n\u00a3521.4 million\n\nOther, including general endowment expenditure\n\n\u00a340.3 million\n\nDepreciation\n\n\u00a359.9 million\n\nTotal\n\n\u00a31,041.3 million\n\nProfitability\n\nThe University is a charity rather than a private or limited company, so we have no shareholders who would expect a return on investment and therefore require a profit. But we do need to make a surplus \u2013 that is, our operating income every year needs to be greater than our operating expenses for that year. This is not for anyone\u2019s individual gain, but to enable us to generate cash reserves that are used for reinvestment in the University\u2019s long-term academic needs \u2013 including buildings, equipment and IT facilities.\n\nNow, more than ever, the University needs to be prepared for an uncertain future, \u00a0given the uncertain future, changing government policies and many other factors. . Any surpluses generated enable us to have sufficient cash to respond for immediate investments in a n uncertain world.\n\nMore details on these topics can be found within the latest\n\nfinancial statements for July 2024\n\n(specifically the section on Value for Money)."

However, if we deem the circumstances to be more severe and in your\n\nvital interests\n\n, we may need to get in touch with the emergency contact irrespective of your choice.\n\nWhen it is in your vital interests\n\nSituations where it is vital to inform an emergency contact can include:\n\nattending or being admitted to hospital in an emergency\n\nsuffering a serious physical injury, including self-harm\n\nceasing to engage with your studies and/or professional support and not responding to repeated attempts to contact you\n\nnot being seen recently in your hall of residence and not responding to repeated contact attempts\n\nhaving an ongoing serious illness, and appearing to deteriorate\n\nexperiencing a mental health crisis where there are serious concerns for your welfare.\n\nEvery circumstance is considered on a case-by-case basis.

This can include the police, ambulance service, the emergency department at the hospital or secondary mental health services.\n\nIn the event of a suspected or confirmed death, the University will share the emergency contacts' details with the emergency services. They will then inform the next of kin.\n\nSharing information with parents and supporters\n\nWe recognise our students as independent adults and we have a legal duty to protect their personal data. Therefore we cannot share any information about them with anyone outside of the University without their consent, unless it is in their vital interests to do so, such as in a serious or life-and-death situation.\n\nStudents can consent to us contacting a designated parent, guardian or friend in situations that are not 'emergencies', but there is still a serious concern for their welfare.\n\nAlthough we can only share information about students with parents/supporters in rare situations where there is a serious concern or where we have the student's consent to do so, we can receive information and will always investigate concerns raised with us.

Email:\n\nuniversity-secretary@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nWhere you can go\n\nEmergency suspension usually means you cannot enter university premises or take part in university activities. We can make special allowances, such as giving you permission to enter a university building if you need to attend a meeting.\n\nWhere you should live\n\nThe University may give you some advice on where you should live during an emergency suspension, depending on your circumstances. Staying with parents, guardians or family might be the healthiest and safest option for some students, but for others it may not. If you are living in a university residence you may need to discuss your options with the Residential Life Service.\n\nInternational students\n\nIf you are an international student living in the UK with a visa, your suspension will have an impact on your visa.

Usually, the earliest that you can do this is after four weeks.\n\nIf you have supporting documents stating that you are fit to study before that time, you can request an immediate review of your suspension.\n\nWhat you need to do to end the suspension\n\nWhen you are ready to return, you will need supporting documents for your health at that time. The University can arrange this for you, or you can get it yourself from any specialists that you are working with.\n\nYou will be invited to a\n\nFitness to Study\n\npanel to review your situation. You can get advice on any aspect of this from the\n\nStudent Union's Academic Advice service."

It helps us understand the difficulties you are facing, reduce risk, and talk about support available.\n\nThe aim of the process is to:\n\nunderstand and reduce risk\n\nclarify your academic situation\n\ndiscuss support available\n\nhelp you to successfully continue your studies where it is safe and realistic to do so.\n\nThere may be occasions, however, where the outcome is temporary suspension or withdrawal from studies.\n\nYou may be referred to the second level of the process if:\n\nyou have already been referred for support through\n\nSupport to Study\n\n,\u00a0but this has not resolved the situation and risk has increased\n\nyour studies have been suspended and we need to assess if you are well enough to resume your course\n\nhigh or urgent risk has been identified. You do not have to go through the initial level of the process first.\n\nHow a referral is made\n\nThe concerned staff will write a referral, with the issues that they think you are facing.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nYou will be put in contact with an independent professional (usually psychiatrist or occupational health therapist). You will be asked to arrange a meeting for them to assess your mental or physical health (as appropriate). The professional will then write a report for the University. They make a recommendation to the University on your fitness to continue your studies. They will also suggest what support you may need to do so.\n\nIt is important that you arrange and attend this meeting as soon as possible. This will allow to process to continue and conclude in good time.\n\nIt is very important that you are open and honest throughout the process. This will allow your situation and any risks to be fully understood.\n\nThe University understands that some students go through very difficult times whilst studying. Wherever possible, we are willing to accept risk and support continuation of studies. However, this depends on this process being transparent, frank and collaborative. All parties must work together to address issues and reduce risk.\n\nYou will then be invited to attend a Panel meeting. This will usually be three weeks after you attended the assessment. You will receive a copy of the referral and the report in advance of this to enable you to prepare. You are welcome to provide other relevant information in advance of the meeting. This may include letters from services supporting you, or a personal statement.\n\nIn rare cases, the staff on the panel may decide that attending the meeting could have a negative impact on your wellbeing. In this case, you might not be invited.\n\nThe meeting\n\nOn the Panel there will usually be:\n\ntwo members of staff from your faculty, one of whom will usually be your senior tutor\n\none member of staff from the Student Wellbeing Service or Residential Life Service\n\na senior member of staff will chair the meeting\n\nanother member of staff will be there to take notes.\n\nYou have the option to bring a friend or family member. Alternatively, you can come with someone from the\n\nStudent Union's Academic Advice service.\n\nThe meeting will discuss the reasons for the referral and the content of the Report and the recommendation within it. You will be able to give your perspective. The panel will ask you questions in order to understand your situation. Their discussion will allow you to understand your academic position and options.\n\nThe meeting will be friendly and supportive. Everybody there will treat you with respect.\n\nPossible outcomes\n\nFollowing the meeting with you, the Panel members will meet separately to come to a decision. This decision will cover whether:\n\nyou are fit to continue your studies\n\nsuccessful completion of your studies is a realistic expectation\n\nattempting to do so would have a negative impact on your health.\n\nThe Panel\u2019s decision is strongly led by the professional\u2019s recommendation. However, other factors will also be taken into account such as:\n\nany changes to your situation\n\nnew information since then\n\nconsideration of impact on others.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes:\n\nContinuing your studies\n\nThe first, which is most common, is that you are found fit to study and can continue your studies. This is usually on the basis that you engage with a support plan or other recommendations. You may be required to attend a following meeting to ensure that you are progressing with the actions agreed. This will help us judge if there has been improvement to your situation.\n\nSuspending your studies\n\nLess commonly, we may need you to suspend your studies for a period of time. This should give you the time to recover from any health issue and/or address any circumstances that have been impacting the situation so that you can return to your studies in a stronger position. We will give you any conditions of that suspension in writing soon after the meeting.\n\nWithdrawal from your studies\n\nIn very rare circumstances, you may be required to withdraw from your course. This will only happen if the panel decide that:\n\nthere are no other options that will help you.\n\nYour academic position is irretrievable.\n\nBeing at the University is putting your or someone else's health or life at risk.\n\nIf you are an international student living in the UK with a visa, suspension or withdrawal will have an impact on your visa. If this is the outcome, you should get advice from the\n\nStudent Visa Service\n\n.\n\nAppealing a decision made by a Fitness to Study panel\n\nYou can appeal any decision made by the Fitness to Study panel to suspend or withdraw you from your studies.\n\nTo do this you should write to the University Secretary at\n\nuniversity-secretary@bristol.ac.uk\n\n. You must do this within 21 working days of the letter informing you of the suspension or withdrawal.\n\nYou should seek advice about any appeals from\n\nthe Student Union's Academic Advice service.\n\nYour appeal will be heard by a committee of the Board of Trustees."

We want to be clear on the reality and the risks; the impact on us all, and how and where to get support.\n\nHow you can help: take suicide prevention training\n\nWe are committed to supporting students manage their wellbeing and mental health challenges. We are also committed to suicide prevention.\n\nTake\u00a0the\n\nfree suicide prevention training\n\noffered by\n\nZero Suicide Alliance\n\n.\n\nIt only takes 20 minutes and you could save someone's life.\n\nOur world today\n\nMental illness, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and self-harm are all real issues for young people. Suicide is the leading cause of death in adolescents and young people in the UK but it can affect people of any age.\n\nStudent suicides are devastating for friends and family and have a profound impact on our wider University community of students and staff.\n\nIn recent years we have experienced clustering of student deaths by suicide at Bristol. This makes our response particularly important.\n\nExposure to suicide\n\nThere is a lot of evidence that exposure to a death by suicide may trigger suicidal thoughts and behaviours in vulnerable people.\n\nThis is called 'contagion' and can lead to a cluster of suicides, in a particular area or within a group.\n\nSo, any death by suicide needs to be reported and managed sensitively to limit distress and reduce the risk of contagion.\n\nOur approach when dealing with a suicide\n\nThe suicide of a close friend or family member can put a vulnerable person at risk. This is why we reach out to the close friends and family of the the person who has died first.\n\nOur priority is to offer them support to help them deal with their feelings. But we don\u2019t always know who was closest to a student and working this out can take time.\n\nWe work with those closest to the person who has died for advice on what we say and to whom.\n\nWe try to\n\nfollow the Samaritans' advice\n\nin these difficult circumstances.\n\nGet help\n\nMany of us will experience suicidal thoughts during our lives and for most of us, this will get better.\n\nMany of those who take their own lives have not asked for help. You are not alone.\n\nIf you or your friend is experiencing suicidal thoughts, talk to someone, let them know what\u2019s going on and ask for help.\n\nWhere to get help at the University\n\nThe Samaritans"

The support to study process is there to help you during these times.\n\nThe Support to Study policy enables the University to take a coordinated approach to support students facing difficulties.\n\nSupport to Study is the first level of the process, meant to understand your difficulties. This is where there is risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of yourself, other students or university activities.

The focus of the meeting will be on improving your situation and supporting your studies.\n\nHow a referral is made\n\nIf staff are concerned you are having difficulties, you may be referred to a Support to Study meeting.\n\nThe concerned staff will write a referral with the issues that they think you are facing. You will receive a copy of this to help you prepare for the meeting.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nYou will be invited to a panel meeting to discuss your situation and support. This will usually be within three weeks of the initial referral.\n\nOn the panel there will usually be:\n\ntwo members of staff from your faculty, one of whom will usually be your senior tutor\n\na member of staff from the Student Wellbeing Service or Residential Life Service who will chair the meeting\n\nanother member of staff will be there to take notes.\n\nYou have the option to bring a friend or family member.\n\nThe meeting\n\nYou will have the chance to discuss the issues that you have been experiencing. This may include what steps you have taken already and what additional support might be helpful.\n\nThe meeting will be friendly and supportive and everybody will treat you with respect.\n\nStaff will ask you questions to understand your situation. This will help decide what support could be useful and make sure you understand your academic position.\n\nYou might want to share supporting documents from your doctor or other professionals. This will help staff to understand what you are experiencing.\n\nOutcomes of the meeting\n\nAn action plan will be agreed to address the issues and help improve your situation.\n\nYou will receive the plan within a week of the meeting.\n\nYou cannot be required to suspend or leave your studies by a Support to Study meeting. It may, however, be discussed as one of your options.\n\nWhat happens if this intervention does not help\n\nIf your situation gets worse, talk about it with any member of staff who is supporting you. They may be able to consider alternative actions. Where appropriate, this may include moving to the next stage of the process,\n\nFitness to Study\n\n.\n\nYou can also consider\n\nsuspending your studies\n\n. This may be because you need time to recover from a health condition or to address circumstantial issues. You can discuss this option and any implications with the staff on the panel."

The Student Counselling Service will always try to inform you if they are going to breach confidentiality, although this may not always be possible.\n\nIn these situations, the Student Counselling Service may have to breach confidentiality with the following (this list is not exhaustive):\n\nParents\n\nConcerned friends\n\nCourts (release of notes)\n\nCoroners\n\nAcademic departments\n\nOther student support services\n\nNHS\n\nCounter-terrorism (via prevent duty)\n\nEmergency contact and opt-in\n\nThe University has an \u2018opt-in\u2019 policy regarding contacting an emergency contact if you are having a mental health crisis.\n\nIf you have consented for your emergency contact to be informed the Student Counselling Service will inform the Student Wellbeing Service, or Resident life Service so they can implement this policy.\n\nYou may request that an alternative contact is informed (not your emergency contact) if you are having a mental health crisis; you must inform the Student Counselling Service of this alternative contact, and this change will only be applicable to the Student Counselling Service.

You can also have more than one emergency contact. It is important that this information is kept up to date.\n\nCircumstances where we may use your emergency contact\n\nThere are two circumstances when the University may reach out to an emergency contact:\n\nWhen there is a serious concern for your welfare\n\nOpting in\n\nAt registration each year, you will be invited to give consent for the University to inform your emergency contact if there is a serious concern about your welfare.\n\nSituations where there is serious concern for your welfare can include:\n\nnot engaging with professional support\n\nnot engaging with your course\n\nusing drugs and/or alcohol in high-risk amounts or combinations\n\nyour mental health appearing to deteriorate\n\nhigh risk self-harm.\n\nYou can opt-out of allowing the University to use your emergency contact in these situations by telling your\n\nFaculty Office\n\n. However, if we deem the circumstances to be more severe and in your\n\nvital interests\n\n, we may need to get in touch with the emergency contact irrespective of your choice.\n\nWhen it is in your vital interests\n\nSituations where it is vital to inform an emergency contact can include:\n\nattending or being admitted to hospital in an emergency\n\nsuffering a serious physical injury, including self-harm\n\nceasing to engage with your studies and/or professional support and not responding to repeated attempts to contact you\n\nnot being seen recently in your hall of residence and not responding to repeated contact attempts\n\nhaving an ongoing serious illness, and appearing to deteriorate\n\nexperiencing a mental health crisis where there are serious concerns for your welfare.\n\nEvery circumstance is considered on a case-by-case basis. We will not use your emergency contact without authorisation by senior staff in the Education and Student Success team.\n\nInforming third parties\n\nThe University may also pass contact details and relevant information about you to external partners. This can include the police, ambulance service, the emergency department at the hospital or secondary mental health services.\n\nIn the event of a suspected or confirmed death, the University will share the emergency contacts' details with the emergency services. They will then inform the next of kin.\n\nSharing information with parents and supporters\n\nWe recognise our students as independent adults and we have a legal duty to protect their personal data. Therefore we cannot share any information about them with anyone outside of the University without their consent, unless it is in their vital interests to do so, such as in a serious or life-and-death situation.\n\nStudents can consent to us contacting a designated parent, guardian or friend in situations that are not 'emergencies', but there is still a serious concern for their welfare.\n\nAlthough we can only share information about students with parents/supporters in rare situations where there is a serious concern or where we have the student's consent to do so, we can receive information and will always investigate concerns raised with us. If you wish to raise your concerns for a student,\n\ncomplete a form\n\nso we can get them the right support."

        "content": "Fitness to study\n\nFitness to Study is the second level of the Support to Study process. It addresses and manages situations where there may be high or urgent risk. It helps us understand the difficulties you are facing, reduce risk, and talk about support available.\n\nThe aim of the process is to:\n\nunderstand and reduce risk\n\nclarify your academic situation\n\ndiscuss support available\n\nhelp you to successfully continue your studies where it is safe and realistic to do so.\n\nThere may be occasions, however, where the outcome is temporary suspension or withdrawal from studies.\n\nYou may be referred to the second level of the process if:\n\nyou have already been referred for support through\n\nSupport to Study\n\n,\u00a0but this has not resolved the situation and risk has increased\n\nyour studies have been suspended and we need to assess if you are well enough to resume your course\n\nhigh or urgent risk has been identified. You do not have to go through the initial level of the process first.\n\nHow a referral is made\n\nThe concerned staff will write a referral, with the issues that they think you are facing.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nYou will be put in contact with an independent professional (usually psychiatrist or occupational health therapist). You will be asked to arrange a meeting for them to assess your mental or physical health (as appropriate). The professional will then write a report for the University. They make a recommendation to the University on your fitness to continue your studies. They will also suggest what support you may need to do so.\n\nIt is important that you arrange and attend this meeting as soon as possible. This will allow to process to continue and conclude in good time.\n\nIt is very important that you are open and honest throughout the process. This will allow your situation and any risks to be fully understood.\n\nThe University understands that some students go through very difficult times whilst studying. Wherever possible, we are willing to accept risk and support continuation of studies. However, this depends on this process being transparent, frank and collaborative. All parties must work together to address issues and reduce risk.\n\nYou will then be invited to attend a Panel meeting. This will usually be three weeks after you attended the assessment. You will receive a copy of the referral and the report in advance of this to enable you to prepare. You are welcome to provide other relevant information in advance of the meeting. This may include letters from services supporting you, or a personal statement.\n\nIn rare cases, the staff on the panel may decide that attending the meeting could have a negative impact on your wellbeing. In this case, you might not be invited.\n\nThe meeting\n\nOn the Panel there will usually be:\n\ntwo members of staff from your faculty, one of whom will usually be your senior tutor\n\none member of staff from the Student Wellbeing Service or Residential Life Service\n\na senior member of staff will chair the meeting\n\nanother member of staff will be there to take notes.\n\nYou have the option to bring a friend or family member. Alternatively, you can come with someone from the\n\nStudent Union's Academic Advice service.\n\nThe meeting will discuss the reasons for the referral and the content of the Report and the recommendation within it. You will be able to give your perspective. The panel will ask you questions in order to understand your situation. Their discussion will allow you to understand your academic position and options.\n\nThe meeting will be friendly and supportive. Everybody there will treat you with respect.\n\nPossible outcomes\n\nFollowing the meeting with you, the Panel members will meet separately to come to a decision. This decision will cover whether:\n\nyou are fit to continue your studies\n\nsuccessful completion of your studies is a realistic expectation\n\nattempting to do so would have a negative impact on your health.\n\nThe Panel\u2019s decision is strongly led by the professional\u2019s recommendation. However, other factors will also be taken into account such as:\n\nany changes to your situation\n\nnew information since then\n\nconsideration of impact on others.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes:\n\nContinuing your studies\n\nThe first, which is most common, is that you are found fit to study and can continue your studies. This is usually on the basis that you engage with a support plan or other recommendations. You may be required to attend a following meeting to ensure that you are progressing with the actions agreed. This will help us judge if there has been improvement to your situation.\n\nSuspending your studies\n\nLess commonly, we may need you to suspend your studies for a period of time. This should give you the time to recover from any health issue and/or address any circumstances that have been impacting the situation so that you can return to your studies in a stronger position. We will give you any conditions of that suspension in writing soon after the meeting.\n\nWithdrawal from your studies\n\nIn very rare circumstances, you may be required to withdraw from your course. This will only happen if the panel decide that:\n\nthere are no other options that will help you.\n\nYour academic position is irretrievable.\n\nBeing at the University is putting your or someone else's health or life at risk.\n\nIf you are an international student living in the UK with a visa, suspension or withdrawal will have an impact on your visa. If this is the outcome, you should get advice from the\n\nStudent Visa Service\n\n.\n\nAppealing a decision made by a Fitness to Study panel\n\nYou can appeal any decision made by the Fitness to Study panel to suspend or withdraw you from your studies.\n\nTo do this you should write to the University Secretary at\n\nuniversity-secretary@bristol.ac.uk\n\n. You must do this within 21 working days of the letter informing you of the suspension or withdrawal.\n\nYou should seek advice about any appeals from\n\nthe Student Union's Academic Advice service.\n\nYour appeal will be heard by a committee of the Board of Trustees."

The support to study process is there to help you during these times.\n\nThe Support to Study policy enables the University to take a coordinated approach to support students facing difficulties.\n\nSupport to Study is the first level of the process, meant to understand your difficulties. This is where there is risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of yourself, other students or university activities. A risk to studies will only be grounds for a referral if there is also risk to your own or other\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nThe aim of support to study is to:\n\nreduce risk\n\nclarify your academic situation\n\ndiscuss support available.\n\nThe focus is on you achieving success and satisfaction in your studies and in student life.\n\nThere is no potential that you will be required to suspend studies at this stage of the policy. The focus of the meeting will be on improving your situation and supporting your studies.\n\nHow a referral is made\n\nIf staff are concerned you are having difficulties, you may be referred to a Support to Study meeting.\n\nThe concerned staff will write a referral with the issues that they think you are facing. You will receive a copy of this to help you prepare for the meeting.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nYou will be invited to a panel meeting to discuss your situation and support. This will usually be within three weeks of the initial referral.\n\nOn the panel there will usually be:\n\ntwo members of staff from your faculty, one of whom will usually be your senior tutor\n\na member of staff from the Student Wellbeing Service or Residential Life Service who will chair the meeting\n\nanother member of staff will be there to take notes.\n\nYou have the option to bring a friend or family member.\n\nThe meeting\n\nYou will have the chance to discuss the issues that you have been experiencing. This may include what steps you have taken already and what additional support might be helpful.\n\nThe meeting will be friendly and supportive and everybody will treat you with respect.\n\nStaff will ask you questions to understand your situation. This will help decide what support could be useful and make sure you understand your academic position.\n\nYou might want to share supporting documents from your doctor or other professionals. This will help staff to understand what you are experiencing.\n\nOutcomes of the meeting\n\nAn action plan will be agreed to address the issues and help improve your situation.\n\nYou will receive the plan within a week of the meeting.\n\nYou cannot be required to suspend or leave your studies by a Support to Study meeting. It may, however, be discussed as one of your options.\n\nWhat happens if this intervention does not help\n\nIf your situation gets worse, talk about it with any member of staff who is supporting you. They may be able to consider alternative actions. Where appropriate, this may include moving to the next stage of the process,\n\nFitness to Study\n\n.\n\nYou can also consider\n\nsuspending your studies\n\n. This may be because you need time to recover from a health condition or to address circumstantial issues. You can discuss this option and any implications with the staff on the panel."

Speak to the\n\nlandlord or letting agency\n\n, and/or contact the\n\nappropriate organisation\n\n.\n\nIf the issue isn\u2019t resolved or you need further support, you can report it to the University. We will formally communicate with students who behave in an unacceptable manner to resolve and monitor problems.\n\nTry to resolve the issue informally\n\nTry to resolve the problem by talking to the students:\n\nIntroduce yourself. You may want to print out our greeting template for saying\n\nhello to student neighbours (PDF, 213kB)\n\nand post it through their door.\n\nSuggest exchanging phone numbers and agree to give them a call if you experience any noise.\n\nYou could also print and post these flyers that address common issues (there are two per page):\n\nbins on the pavement (PDF, 118kB)\n\nincorrectly sorted recycling (PDF, 169kB)\n\noverflowing bins (PDF, 106kB)\n\ngoing away for the holidays (PDF, 118kB)\n\nIf this does not resolve the problem, you can report the behaviour or make a complaint.\n\nHow to make a report to the University\n\nTo make a report about student behaviour, complete the\n\nCommunity living report form (Office document, 40kB)\n\nand email it to our Community Liaison Officer at\n\ncommunity-living@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nYour personal details are treated in confidence by the University and will only be used and stored to:\n\ninvestigate complaints\n\nand undertake any necessary disciplinary actions.\n\nAnyone raising a formal report is expected to identify themselves. We will not take action against a student about a problem reported anonymously unless it is possible to verify the issue.\n\nGenerally, if you make a complaint, your name is protected and not shared with students. However, as part of the later stage of the formal disciplinary process, it may be necessary to provide your name to a student. In this situation, you will be asked for consent before we share this information.\n\nThere is a\n\nprotocol for responding to student misconduct in the community (PDF, 178kB)\n\n\u200c\n\nbetween the University of Bristol, the University of the West of England, and the Bristol City Council Neighbourhood Enforcement Team.\n\nReport to the landlord or letting agency\n\nYou may choose to report your problem to the landlord or letting agency.\n\nYou can find the name and address of a property owner via\n\nLand Registry\n\n. There is a small fee for this service.\n\nYou can also use the\n\nregister of licensed properties\n\nto request a landlord or letting agency's contact details for a house of multiple occupancy. Members of the public can make up to 3 requests at any one time.\n\nIf you rent a property to student tenants and are dealing with complaints, read our\n\nguidance for landlords and letting agents\n\n.\n\nContacts and support for specific issues\n\nThe University of Bristol does not have legal enforcement powers in many situations. You may wish to contact another organisation for assistance with the following issues.\n\nNoise\n\nThe\n\nBristol City Council Neighbourhood Enforcement Team\n\nhave legal powers to deal with noise complaints, including Noise Abatement Notices, formal cautions, and prosecution with fines of up to \u00a35,000. In extreme cases involving loud music, the council can also confiscate music equipment.\n\nIf you experience a persistent noise problem, the council requires you to keep a\n\n14-day noise diary\n\nbefore making a complaint.\n\nYou can also report the pre-planning of unlicensed or potential large unlicensed gatherings and one-off events.\n\nYou can\n\nreport a noise problem\n\nvia the Bristol City Council website.\n\nOperation Beech\n\nThe University of Bristol works with Avon and Somerset police to provide an on-the-night response to noise disturbances believed to be caused by our students. Extra police patrols are added to some student areas on specific days of the week.\n\nIf you are disturbed by a house party or street noise caused by University of Bristol students between 8 pm and 2 am on a Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday, text the street name and house number to\n\n+44 (0)7773 816 248\n\n. Police patrols will respond on a priority basis.\n\nThe designated area includes all roads within the border of Chandos Road, Hampton Road, Redland Grove, and Trelawney Road, with the addition of:\n\nAshgrove Road\n\nManor Park\n\nHighbury Villas\n\nEaton Crescent\n\nArlington Villas\n\nOn days when Operation Beech is not running, you can report noise and anti-social behaviour directly to the police by phoning 101. If a crime is in progress, there is a danger to life, or if violence is used or threatened, phone 999.\n\nPatrols have now stopped and will resume on Friday 9th January 2026.\n\nWaste and recycling\n\nVisit\n\nBristol City Council\u2019s bins and recycling pages\n\nto report misuse of recycling services, bins left on the pavement and missed collections.\n\nYou can\n\nreport fly-tipping\n\nvia the Bristol City Council website too.\n\nParking\n\nIf a vehicle is preventing you from exiting your driveway, contact the police on 101.\n\nIf a vehicle is preventing you from entering your driveway or is parked on zigzag lines, double yellow lines or single yellow lines during restricted times, contact Bristol City Council Parking Services on\n\n+44 (0)117 922 2000\n\n. Ask for parking services and select option 4.\n\nCriminal and anti-social behaviour\n\nComplaints about criminal and anti-social behaviour, including vandalism and harassment, should always be made to the police on 101. Phone 999 for emergencies.\n\nVisit the\n\nAvon and Somerset Police website\n\nfor further advice and information.\n\nGuidance for landlords and letting agents\n\nIf you receive a complaint about University of Bristol student tenants, email our Community Liaison Officer at\n\ncommunity-living@bristol.ac.uk\n\nfor assistance.\n\nIf you receive a complaint about UWE student tenants, contact\n\ncommunity@uwe.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nWe believe the most effective way to respond to an allegation of student misconduct is for the Community Liaison Officer and the landlord or letting agent to visit the property and talk to the tenants together.\n\nIn most cases, once students are aware of complaints, the offending behaviour stops. However, if the behaviour continues and further complaints are received, we will take action in accordance with the University's\n\nStudent Disciplinary Regulations and Procedure.\n\nWe encourage you to share the following resources with all University of Bristol students at the start of their tenancy:\n\nGuidelines for student behaviour in the community\n\n.\n\nCommunity behaviour rules for all students.\n\nStudent Disciplinary Regulations and Procedure\n\n.\n\nThe University\u2019s framework for dealing with allegations of student misconduct.\n\nBristol Waste Company student recycling guide\n\n.\n\nHelpful guides for what to recycle and when.\n\nAnti-social behaviour of tenants\n\n.\n\nA best practice guide for landlords and letting agents from Bristol City Council."

You will also need to have an ATAS certificate before the University can issue your\n\nCAS\n\nIf you are coming to the UK as a visiting student on a Visit visa\n\n,\u00a0you will need to have an ATAS clearance certificate to show on arrival at the University\n\nIf you are applying to come to the UK on a non-Student visa*\n\n(e.g. Student visa Dependant, Skilled Worker Dependant, Skilled Worker), you will need to have a valid ATAS clearance certificate to show on arrival at the University. You will not require it as part of your visa application to come to the UK\n\nIf you are unsure if your visa requires you to obtain an ATAS clearance certificate, please\n\ncontact Student Visas\n\n.\n\nWho is not required to have an ATAS certificate\n\nIf you have settled status* in the UK\u00a0(e.g. indefinite leave to remain), you do not need an ATAS clearance certificate\n\nIf you are a UK national\n\nIf you are a national of one of the countries listed in the UKVI\u2019s\n\nFind out if you need an ATAS certificate - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)\n\n. If you are one of the listed nationals you will not be required to apply for ATAS.\u00a0 Only those not listed need to read the information on these webpages\n\n*If you are unsure if your visa requires you to obtain an ATAS clearance certificate, please\n\ncontact Student Visas\n\n.\n\nPlease be advised that it is your responsibility to obtain an ATAS clearance certificate if it is required. If you hold immigration permission that requires ATAS for study (even if it was not required for the visa application), you will not be permitted to register at the University without showing a valid ATAS clearance certificate.\n\nCourse changes and ATAS certificates\n\nIf you currently have an ATAS for your studies and want to change to another area of research or programme requiring an ATAS, you need to:\n\nCheck with a Student Visa Adviser if you require a new visa for the new course\n\nApply for a new ATAS certificate - please ask the Faculty Office or a Student Visa Adviser what the new CAH3 code is\n\nEnsure you have made it clear on the application form that a new certificate is for a course you have been studying already. This should make the application processing quicker\n\nWait until you have received it before you register on/transfer to your new programme or start the new area of research - you should not start it until appropriate ATAS clearance has been received\n\nIf you are currently on a programme that does not need ATAS but you need to switch to a programme that requires ATAS clearance (e.g. if you are switching from BEng to MEng or BSc to MSci), you must also follow the steps above.\n\nYou will also need to apply for a new ATAS certificate within 28 days in the following circumstances:\n\nYour course end date is extended by more than 3 months\n\nYour primary supervisor has changed\n\nYour financial sponsor\n\nor conditions for financial sponsorship\n\nhave changed\n\nI've received my ATAS Certificate - what do I need to do now?\n\nIf your ATAS application is successful, you will receive a certificate by email. You should check your junk folders regularly to ensure the email has not been filtered out. When you receive your certificate, you should:\n\ncheck that the description matches your offer letter if you are a research student, or course content from module catalogue if you are a taught student\n\nif the details such a course name and personal details are correct\n\ncontact the ATAS unit at ATAS@fcdo.gov.uk if there are mistakes or inaccuracies\n\nonce you are satisfied that all is correct, include the certificate in your Student visa application documents, if applying for a visa. ATAS certificates are only valid for Student visa application purposes for 6 months (the expiry date is listed on the certificate). If you decide to delay your visa application and your certificate has expired, you will need to get a new certificate\n\nWhat can you do if your ATAS application is refused?\n\nIf your course requires ATAS clearance, without an ATAS certificate you will not be granted a Student visa to study in the UK.\u00a0Applications for visas to study on other courses that do not require ATAS clearance will be considered without an ATAS certificate.\n\nContinuing students who are extending studies and who have been refused fresh ATAS clearance will not be able to study the course from the UK unless the decision is overturned. They should contact us on\n\nstudent-visas@bristol.ac.uk\n\n, and should also discuss their academic options with their supervisor and the Faculty Office.\n\nIf you think your application has been treated unfairly you can ask the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to review your case. In our experience, if you have not had ATAS for this course before, the review application success rate is low.\n\nYou can ask for an appeal by contacting the ATAS Team at:\n\nATAS@fcdo.gov.uk\n\n.\n\nIt is not recommended to submit several\n\nconsecutive ATAS applications for the same programme.\n\nHow can I contact the ATAS team at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office?\n\nYou can contact the ATAS Team at:\n\nATAS@fcdo.gov.uk\n\nif you have a question about your application. Their current service standard for replying is listed on\n\nthe ATAS page\n\n. During busier times over the summer responses can take considerably longer.\n\nIf you wish to study at another University/Higher Education Institution, change your course/area of research or extend your course end date by more than three months, you will need to apply for a new ATAS certificate.

Please generate a share code before boarding the plane.\n\nIf however you return to the UK shortly before your eVisa expires and after your study end date has passed, the border officers may ask you some additional questions to understand why are you returning to the UK so close to your visa expiry date. You should be prepared to reply to these questions. To support this, you may choose to prepare some paperwork and carry it with you when re-entering the UK:\n\nIf you have received email invitation or any related communication from the Graduation Office about your graduation ceremony, this evidence could also prove to be useful when re-entering the UK on your Student visa for your graduation;\n\nA copy of your return ticket home (if available).\n\nA copy of your Graduate Route reporting email from\n\nstudent-visas@bristol.ac.uk\n\nif you plan to apply for the Graduate Route\n\nPlease do not forget to leave the UK or apply for another visa if eligible before your current visa expires to avoid overstaying.\n\nIf your Student visa expires before your graduation date\n\nIf your Student visa expires before your graduation ceremony, your visa options to attend the graduation are as follows:\n\n1) leave the UK and re-enter on\n\nStandard Visitor visa\n\nbut re-entry would have to be after your Student visa has already expired. This is to ensure you are not admitted on a Student visa which would cause the risk of overstaying. If you arrive during your Student visa validity, you would automatically be admitted on your Student visa as it is more favourable leave.\n\nVisitor visa allows to remain in the UK for up to 6 months. Some nationalities would be able to gain entry at the border on arrival for free, but will be required to apply for\n\nelectronic travel authorisation (ETA)\n\nprior to travel. Other nationalities must apply for and obtain the Standard Visitor visa from a visa application centre in their home country for a fee. Please see our\n\nStandard Visitor visa webpage\n\nfor more information.\n\n2) Apply for the\n\nGraduate visa\n\nwhich allows students to remain in the UK for further 2 or 3 years (depending on your course) to live and work in the UK. This would require paying the IHS and the visa application fees. You should be able to apply for Graduate Route visa from inside the UK after you have been made successful and whilst you still have a valid Student visa.\n\nIf you are exiting with a lower award or downgrading after third year exams\n\nIf you are exiting with a lower award or downgrading in your third year after your final exams (for example, MEng to BEng, MSci to BSc etc), the University will have to report this change in your circumstances to the UKVI and as a consequence your visa will be shortened.\n\nThe below guidance applies if you are not staying in the UK to apply for the Graduate Route visa or any other type of visa.\n\nIf you downgrade / exit with a lower award shortly after your third year exams and:\n\nif you stay in the UK between your results release date and your graduation date\n\n, you can remain in the UK on your Student visa to attend your graduation ceremony. Please make sure you read all email / post communication about visa cancellation sent to you by us or the UKVI and do not overstay the 4-month period stated in our email communication.\n\nif you\n\nleave the UK between your results release date and the date of graduation ceremony\n\n, we do not generally advise you attempt to re-enter the UK on the same Student visa during your visa curtailment (shortened) period. After we have notified the UKVI about you exiting with a lower award, you can normally only leave the UK once and, depending on where the UKVI are with processing the University's report, may not be allowed to re-enter on the same visa, even if the 4-month period has not yet elapsed. The visa may also lapse if you are already outside the UK when the report is made. Please see our\n\nearly completion of studies webpage\n\nfor more details.\u00a0 In these scenarios it is usually advisable to apply for a\n\nStandard Visitor Visa\n\nto re-enter the UK for your graduation but this may depend on a few factors - please\n\ncontact us\n\nfor further advice.\n\nAttending your graduation on Standard Visitor Visa\n\nIf your visa expires before your graduation day and you are not applying for the\n\nGraduate Route visa\n\n, or another type of visa from inside the UK, you will have to obtain a\n\nStandard Visitor Visa\n\n.\n\nPlease see our\n\nStandard Visitor visa webpage\n\nfor information.\n\nSome nationalities must obtain a Visitor visa from their home country in advance while others can obtain this visa at the UK border. You can use\n\nthis government tool\n\nto determine this. If it says \"you do not need a visa\", this means that you will not need to obtain one in advance but would have to request it at the border.\n\nYou\n\ncannot apply\n\nfor a Standard Visitor Visa\n\nin the UK\n\nYou\n\ncannot switch\n\nfrom a Student visa to a Standard Visitor Visa when you are\n\nin the UK\n\nCheck here if you need to apply for a Standard Visitor Visa\n\nbefore you travel to the UK:\n\nIf you are required to apply for your Standard Visitor Visa before your travel to the UK, please do so from your\n\nhome country\n\n;\n\nIf you are a non-visa national and can be granted permission to enter as a Standard Visitor at the border, please read the guidance on what documents to prepare\n\nhere\n\n.\u00a0 Please be aware that you will be required to apply for\n\nelectronic travel authorisation (ETA)\n\nprior to travel even though you will not have to apply for the visa prior to travel.\n\nSome nationalities obtain a Visitor visa by going through eGates and will not receive a stamp. Please see\n\nthis page\n\nfor the current list. They must retain proof of travel as evidence that their permission started on the date of entry.\n\nPlease see our\n\nStandard Visitor visa webpage\n\nfor more information.\n\nSupporting documents for your Standard Visitor Visa\n\nOnce\n\nyou have received your graduation invitation email\n\nand\n\ncompleted the online form confirming your attendance, y\n\nou can request a visa support letter to support your Standard Visitor Visa application.\n\nVisa support letter confirms that:\n\nyou are eligible to attend your graduation if the University confirms your academic award\n\nthe date of your graduation ceremony.\n\nGuests\u2019 names are not included in the letter so please be aware that the letter cannot include parents' names for their Standard Visitor visa application.\u00a0 Two guest tickets are guaranteed for the ceremony.\u00a0 To support your parents' visa application, you could write an invitation letter for your parents to join you for your graduation and include a copy of the visa support letter from the Graduation Office to confirm your graduation.\n\nHow to request a visa support letter\n\nTo request your visa support letter, please email:\n\ngraduation-office@bristol.ac.uk\n\nwith the following information:\n\nrequest a visa letter for graduation\n\nyour name\n\nstudent number\n\npostal address\n\nThe Graduation Office will only be able to issue this letter if you have received your graduation invitation email and completed the online form confirming your attendance.\u00a0 Please remember that that the Graduation Office will not be able to include parents' names on this letter.\n\nApply for Standard Visitor visa"

If you are eligible a combined CAS will be issued by default, but you can request a single CAS if you prefer this option. For further information please visit the \"\n\nCombined CAS\n\n\" section of the website.\n\nWe do not advise using the\n\nStandard Visitor permission\n\nfor studying the Pre-sessional course. This is because you will not be able to able to apply for a Student visa for the substantive course from inside the UK in September. The time period between completion of Pre-sessional course and the start of the new course will not usually be sufficient to obtain a Student visa from overseas. If you understand the risks of studying the Pre-sessional course on Visitor permission and are happy to proceed with this option, it will be permitted for registration as long as your Visitor visa covers the course.\n\nAlthough Student visas granted for longer than 6 months will now require an\n\neVisa\n\n, visas issued for the Pre-sessional course only are still granted as vignettes (stickers) in passport.

Information for students joining in 2026 will be published in early 2026.\n\nCombined CAS vs single CAS\n\nA combined CAS covers both the pre-sessional and the main course of study, which means that a student will only need to apply for one visa. Some students who have met all the academic conditions of their offer for the main course of study by the point in time when CAS is issued can receive a combined CAS. This will also depend on whether they have an outstanding English language condition and, if so, the level they are required to meet.\n\nWhile combined CAS is the most convenient option for many students, there are some additional considerations associated with it listed in the dropdowns below \u2013 please read them before making a decision.\n\nStudents who want a CAS for the 6 week pre-sessional only must also have an accepted\n\nSecure English Language Test (SELT)\n\n. Those students who have not met the academic conditions of their offer by the point a CAS is issued and who have an accepted SELT, will receive a single CAS to cover just the pre-sessional course in the first instance. You would need to meet the financial requirements for the pre-sessional course only when you apply using a single CAS. If all tuition fees are paid, this would be \u00a32272* (to cover the living expenses) held for 28 days. You would then need to apply for another visa to cover the rest of your studies once you have passed the language course and have met all the conditions of your offer.\n\nA combined CAS has its advantages and disadvantages. You can read about them below. Please consider your options carefully before applying for a Student visa and opt out of the combined CAS if it is not suitable for you. You are welcome to\n\ncontact\u00a0Student Visa Services\n\nfor further advice on these options.\n\nIf you wish to find out whether you are eligible for a combined CAS please email\n\ncald-pre-sessional@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\nIf you are eligible, but would like to\u00a0receive\u00a0a single CAS just for the pre-sessional course please email\n\ncald-pre-sessional@bristol.ac.uk\n\n.\n\n*figure correct as of December 2024 but may be subject to change.\n\nBenefits of a combined CAS\n\nYou make only one visa application and\u00a0secure\u00a0a visa for the entire duration of your studies. There is no need to extend your visa when you\u00a0complete\u00a0the pre-sessional course\u00a0in September\n\nYou pay only one visa application fee\n\nAs you do not need to go through the visa application process in the autumn, you are free to travel outside the UK during that time\u00a0if your academic schedule permits\n\nIf you have dependants and your main course of study makes you\n\neligible to bring them to the UK\n\n, they can join you in the UK straight away instead of needing to wait until you have a CAS/visa for your main course of study\n\nIf you are currently studying a degree-level course in the UK, you may be able to apply for the Bristol visa from the UK instead of having to return to your home country to apply for the visa that only covers the pre-sessional course. This is because of\n\nthe\u00a0academic\u00a0progression\n\nrequirements\n\nYou\u00a0\u00a0can\u00a0have access to\u00a0the National Health Service in the UK as soon as you arrive as you will have\u00a0paid\u00a0the\n\nImmigration Health Surcharge\n\nfee as part of your application\n\nYou are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week instead of 10 hours a week while you are on the Pre-sessional course. We would not however recommend this for academic reasons\n\nPossible issues with a combined CAS\n\nYou will need to meet the visa requirements for the entire duration of your stay in the UK when you apply for the combined visa. This involves holding the amount necessary to cover the tuition fees for both courses (unless paid upfront), as well as \u00a3\n\n10,224*\n\nfor living expenses in a bank account for 28 days before you apply for the visa. This is considerably higher than financial requirements for the visa that covers the pre-sessional course only\n\nIf you are sponsored, the sponsor would need to issue a letter saying they will sponsor both programmes\n\nAlthough you only pay one visa application fee, you will be required to pay an\n\nImmigration Health Surcharge fee\n\nat the time of your application. This is a substantial amount. You are not required to pay this fee for shorter visas that are under 6 months in duration\n\nYou will also need a Tuberculosis test result if you are from a country where TB testing is required - please see\n\nthis government webpage\n\n. This is not required\u00a0for\u00a0shorter\u00a0visas that are under\u00a06 months in duration.\n\nIf you leave your studies early or decide not to proceed with the main course of study stated on CAS, your visa will be cancelled. The Immigration Health Surcharge fee and the visa application fee will not be refunded\n\nIt may not be possible to change the main course of study as Student visa is issued to study a particular course only\n\nIf you do not pass the pre-sessional course and are unable to progress to your\u00a0expected\u00a0main course\u00a0of study,\u00a0you visa will be cancelled. The Immigration Health Surcharge fee and the visa application fee will not be refunded\n\nIf you no longer wish to do the pre-sessional course after you arrive because you have an unconditional offer for the main course of study, you will still be required to attend the pre-sessional course\u00a0and all exams\u00a0as\u00a0this is\u00a0a condition of your visa\n\n*figure correct as of December 2024 but can be subject to change"

The purpose of this is to verify that you are a genuine and credible student and that you meet the English language requirements to study in the UK. The interviews normally take place online via video link and are conducted by UKVI staff members.\n\nThe interviewer will ask you questions about yourself, your immigration/travel history and your reason for choosing the UK for study. You should also be prepared to answer questions about the course you have chosen (including course structure and module options) and how this will influence your future career.\n\nYou can prepare for the interview by reviewing the information that you have provided in your application, and researching your choice of course.\n\nThere is a link to the course prospectus here that will provide information about the course structure and modules:\n\nUndergraduate study\n\nPostgraduate study\n\nSome questions you may wish to consider:\n\n\u00b7 Why do you want to study in the UK? Have you considered other countries for study, which ones and how did you research these options?\n\n\u00b7 Why did you choose this specific course? What about is appeals to you, and which modules specifically will you find useful or interesting?\n\n\u00b7 What are your future plans after completing your studies and how does this course help with your career goals?\n\n\u00b7 How will you fund your studies in the UK? How much are your course fees? If the course is available for less cost in your home country, what is the reason that you would choose to pay extra to study in the UK?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits of studying in the UK compared to your home country?\n\n\u00b7 How do you explain any gaps in your study/professional history?\n\n\u00b7 Where will you live while you are studying in the UK? How far will that be from where your classes will be held and how do you plan to travel to class?\n\nYou will be able to find videos online that show you how the interview might look.

If you have received money from other sources not on the list above, this does not count as Official Financial Sponsorship.\n\nIf you do not have Official Financial Sponsorship, or your official financial sponsor is only covering part of your course fees or living costs, you must show in your visa application that you have the money needed to cover the remaining costs.\n\nEvidence needed for sponsored students\n\nWhen applying for your visa, you must provide a letter from your official financial sponsor with all details of your sponsorship.\n\nThe letter must be printed on official headed paper from your sponsor\u2019s organisation, and must include:\n\nyour name, including confirmation that you are the recipient;\n\nthe name and contact details of your official financial sponsor;\n\nthe date of the sponsorship;\n\nthe length of the sponsorship;\n\na statement that your official financial sponsor will cover all your tuition fees and living costs. If your sponsor is not covering all tuition fees and living costs, the letter must include the amount of money they are giving you. You will also need to include additional evidence that you have the funds available to cover the remaining fees and costs.\n\nIf you are being sponsored by an Official Financial Sponsor, or have been sponsored within the last 12 months before your application and you have completed your course and are moving onto another course, your letter must confirm that your sponsor gives their unconditional consent for you to remain in the UK.\u00a0 You do not require this letter if the University of Bristol was your sponsor.\n\nEvidence needed for University of Bristol scholarship students\n\nIf you have received sponsorship in the form of a University of Bristol scholarship, you do not need to provide a letter with your visa application. Instead, the University of Bristol should include details of the of your Official Financial Sponsorship on your CAS, please check that your CAS has this information.\n\nApplication Costs\n\nYou can find out about the current application costs on\n\nthis government webpage\n\n. As well as the application fee, you will also need to pay\n\nthe Immigration Health Surcharge\n\n, which is set at \u00a3776 per each year of visa and is calculated in 6-month blocks. Please visit\n\nthis webpage\n\nfor information on how the UKVI calculate the IHS payments. Wrap-up time awarded after the CAS end date will be counted as well, so a student taking a 4-year PhD programme for example will be liable for 4.5 years of IHS payments upfront.\n\nIf your sponsor is covering these costs, they may choose to pay your costs at the time of application, or may prefer to reimburse you for the application costs at a later date, in which case you should make sure you save the payment confirmation from the UKVI at the time of payment. This is especially relevant with IHS payments as they do not appear on the application form. Student Visas are not able to provide letters confirming how much IHS a student paid at the time of application as those fees are paid to the UKVI.\n\nEvidence needed to apply under the differentiation arrangement\n\nIf applying under the differentiation arrangement,\n\napplicants are not required to submit a letter of financial evidence when they apply for a visa. However, we strongly advise that such applicants prepare their financial evidence anyway. This is because the UK Government may ask to see this when reviewing an application and failure to provide it will result in a refusal of the visa application. Find out more about\n\napplying under the differentiation arrangement\n\n."

        "content": "Academic Progression\n\nIf you have previously had a Student or a Tier 4 (General) Student visa, the University can only give you a CAS if your new course represents academic progress from your previous studies.\n\nIf you are currently in the UK with a Student/Tier 4 visa and wish to apply for a new Student visa, your eligibility to do this without leaving the UK would depend on the level of your studies, as well as on whether your current course has been successfully completed. If you have leave in a different immigration category, please\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice.\n\nSometimes when you are progressing from one programme of study to the next, you will not yet have your course results by the time you need to make a new visa application and start your new course. As long as your new programme is not at a lower level, you may still meet the academic progression requirement for applying inside the UK if you obtain a letter that says that you are \"highly likely to complete\" your current programme.\u00a0 This letter will be based on results from studies to date at the time the letter is granted, usually after the taught elements in the case of a postgraduate taught programme.\n\nPlease note that if you are relying on this letter to meet the academic progression requirement to apply for your next Student visa in the UK, any new visa granted may be cancelled if you subsequently fail to receive an award of your previous qualification.\u00a0 If you think there is a risk that you might fail/have failed the final part of your course it will be safer to apply overseas as there is no academic progression requirement if you are applying overseas.\n\nSome common scenarios concerning academic progression for Student/Tier 4 visa holders are described below.\n\nStarting a new course at a higher academic level than your previous course\n\nThis would normally represent academic progression and in most cases no extra justification is required. This is likely when you are:\n\nmoving from A-level study to an undergraduate course at university;\n\nmoving from a foundation/pathway course to an undergraduate course at university;\n\nmoving from an undergraduate course to a taught postgraduate programme;\n\nmoving from an undergraduate or postgraduate taught course to a PhD programme.\n\nYou must have completed your previous course and achieved the qualification for which you were studying in order to be eligible to apply in the UK. If some of your course results are not yet finalised, you may still be able to apply in the UK provided you are deemed to be highly likely to successfully complete the course. We would often state this on your CAS but if you are coming from another institution, we would need to see a letter from them first.\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\n\nStarting a new course at the same level as your previous course\n\nIf your new course is at the same level as the previous course, it may exceptionally be considered to represent academic progression provided at least one of the below requirements is met:\n\nthe new course relates to your previous course\n\n(it is either connected to the previous course, part of the same subject group, or involves deeper specialisation)\n\n; or\n\nyour previous and new course combined support your career aspirations.\n\nAs part of the admission application process and prior to being issued a CAS, you will be asked to provide a\u00a0written progression\u00a0statement to demonstrate how the new course you have applied for represents\u00a0academic\u00a0progression. The personal statement would need to include:\n\nYour reasons for studying another course at the same level and for choosing Bristol and that particular course\n\nWhat your career aspirations are and how both courses will help you achieve them\n\nHow the new course is similar to the previous course and how it is different\n\nWhether your previous course is successfully completed (you achieved the qualification for which your last visa was granted), or currently in progress, or not successfully completed (e.g. you withdrew from the course or you left early and were awarded a different qualification). If you did not complete your previous course, please give details\n\nWhere you intend to apply for a Student visa\n\nYou will also need to send copies of all your UK visas and previous CAS with your statement. Please note if you are not able to provide these documents and we feel we need more information to accurately assess your application we may ask your permission to contact UKVI to confirm your previous immigration history.\n\nThis information will be assessed and if\u00a0progression\u00a0is deemed to be justified and you meet the entry requirements for your course and are subsequently made an offer of study, you\u00a0may\u00a0be issued with a CAS in order to apply for a Student visa. Please note that if UKVI decide to invite you for a credibility interview as part of the application process, they may question why you wish to study two courses at the same level.\n\nYou must have completed your previous course and achieved the qualification for which you were studying in order to be eligible to apply in the UK. If some of your course results are not yet finalised, you may still be able to apply in the UK provided you are deemed to be highly likely to successfully complete the course. We would normally state this on your CAS but if you are coming from another institution, we would need to see a letter from them first.\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\n\nIf you are doing two courses back to back, e.g. starting a Master\u2019s course in September while still being registered on your previous Master\u2019s course, we strongly suggest that you wait until at least one month before the end date of your current course to make your visa application. This is because it is important that you continue holding the correct visa for the course on which you are registered.\n\nStarting a new course at a lower level than your previous course\n\nTo demonstrate academic progression, the new course must normally be above the level of the previous course for which you were given Student or Tier 4 student leave. A course at a lower level does not meet the academic progression requirements. It is unlikely that we will be able to offer a CAS supporting a course at a lower level, however in exceptional circumstances we may consider issuing a CAS for a visa application overseas as you would not be eligible to apply in the UK.\n\nIf you still wish to be considered for a CAS, as part of the admission application process you will be asked to provide a\u00a0written progression\u00a0statement to demonstrate how the new course you have applied for represents\u00a0academic\u00a0progression. The personal statement would need to include:\n\nYour reasons for studying a course at a lower level and for choosing Bristol and that particular course\n\nWhat your career aspirations are and how both courses will help you achieve them\n\nHow the new course is similar to the previous course and how is it different?\n\nWhether your previous course is successfully completed (you achieved the qualification for which your last visa was granted), or currently in progress, or not successfully completed (for example you withdrew from the course or you left early and were awarded a different qualification). If you did not complete your previous course, please give details\n\nWhere you intend to apply for a Student visa\n\nYou would also need to send copies of all your UK visas and previous CAS with your statement. Please note if you are not able to provide these documents and we feel we need more information to accurately assess your application we may ask your permission to contact UKVI to confirm your previous immigration history.\n\nThis information will be assessed and if progression is deemed to be justified and you meet the entry requirements for your course and are subsequently made an offer of study, you may be issued with a CAS in order to apply for a Student visa. You would be required to leave the UK in order to apply for a Student visa. It is likely that UKVI will invite you for a credibility interview as part of the application process as they may question why you wish to study a course that is at a lower level than your previous qualification.\n\nWho can apply for a Student visa inside the UK?\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\u00a0 As well as meeting the 28 day requirement, you need to meet the following requirements.\n\nTo be eligible to apply for your visa inside the UK, you must have successfully completed the course for which you were last granted Student or Tier 4 student leave or, if you were permitted to change courses with the same sponsor, the course you changed to. In addition to that, your new course cannot be at a lower level than your previous one. There are several exceptions to the successful completion rule, listed below:\n\nYou are applying for a visa to re-sit an examination, repeat a module or take a supplementary year, or you have previously re-sat examinations, repeated modules or taken a supplementary year and require leave to remain to complete your course;\n\nYou are applying for a new visa to progress from a Bachelor\u2019s to Master\u2019s level course as part of an integrated Master\u2019s course, or a Master\u2019s to PhD level course as part of an integrated Master\u2019s and PhD programme. Please see our information about\n\nTransferring your course\n\n;\n\nYou are applying for further leave to complete the PhD or other doctoral qualification for which you were last given Student/Tier 4 student leave (including where you are completing the qualification at a new University). Please see our infomation about\n\nExtending your studies\n\n;\n\nYou are applying to extend your leave in order to undertake a study abroad programme or work placement or you have previously completed a study abroad programme or work placement and require leave to remain to complete your course. Please see our information about\n\nTransferring your course\n\n;\n\nYou are a Child Student/Tier 4 (Child) Student;\n\nYou are applying for a visa to pursue an intercalating course as part of your medical, dental or veterinary science degree, or you are returning to your original course having completed your intercalated course;\n\nYou are applying for a Student visa to undertake a role as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer, or to complete the qualification for which you were last given Tier 4/Student leave after a period as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer;\n\nYou are applying as a postgraduate doctor or dentist on a recognised Foundation Programme;\n\nYou are making a first application to complete an existing course that was commenced at a Student/Tier 4 visa Sponsor institute that had its licence revoked.\n\nIf you are not sure whether or not you meet any of the above requirements, or you hold a non-Tier 4/Student visa, please\n\ncontact us\n\nso that we can advise. Should you need to leave the UK to make a visa application, it is important to do so in good time as you would have to allow enough time to apply for and obtain your visa overseas."

        "content": "Time limits on study\n\nDepending on the level of study, there can be strict time limits on how long a student can spend holding a Student visa. Please read the information specific to each level of study below.\n\nStudying under degree level\n\nIf the course is below degree level e.g. foundation course or A-Levels, you are allowed to spend no more than 2 years on a Student visa from the age of 18. This 2-year limit does not include any time spent as a Child Student/Tier 4 (Child) when you were aged 17 years and under, Student/Tier 4 (General) when you were 16 or 17 years old or on any other non-Tier 4 or Student visa category which permits study.\n\nIf you have studied a foundation course while holding a combined Student visa for the foundation year and the main degree programme, the undergraduate degree-level time limits will apply.\n\nIf there were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely, this may represent an exception to the two-year time limit. For more information on this please see the \"How are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\" dropdown\n\nStudying at undergraduate degree level\n\nAs a rule, when studying at undergraduate degree level your time as a Student/Tier 4 student is limited to a maximum of five years. There are a few exceptions to this rule, some are listed below:\n\nYou are undertaking a course in dentistry, medicine and veterinary science\n\nYou are undertaking a course in\n\narchitecture, or\n\nmusic at a music college that is a member of Conservatoires UK. These options are not offered at the University of Bristol\n\nYou have completed a UK degree and are applying to complete certain professional law programmes, e.g. a law conversion course\n\nThere were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely. For more information on this please see the \"How are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\" dropdown\n\nStudying at postgraduate degree level\n\nThere is no visa time limit on studying postgraduate courses at RQF level 7 and above. This includes Master's degrees, integrated undergraduate + Master's degrees (e.g. MEng and MSci), MPhil and MRes, PhD and other doctorate qualifications.\n\nHow are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\n\nYour time limit is calculated based on the length of visas granted to you and not duration of courses studied. The UKVI will consider how much leave you have already received to study courses as a Student/Tier 4 (General) holder and add the length of leave that you will receive if your current application is granted. Any additional time before and after any course is counted, as well as time spent outside the UK and on vacation.\n\nIf you have previously studied in the UK, the University will assess whether or not you are likely to exceed the time limit before issuing you a CAS. It is therefore very important that you declare all the previous courses you have studied and all the Student visas you have held in your application for admission. You are also welcome to\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss the time limits prior to this stage.\n\nIf you are a current University of Bristol student and require an academic extension that will take you over the relevant time limit, the University will not generally be able to issue you a CAS for this.\n\nIn some cases where\n\nthere were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely, the University may be able to exceptionally issue a CAS for an extra year of study\n\n. An example of such circumstances would be a documented serious illness or injury during your studies. If this applies to you, please\n\ncontact us\n\nas soon as you find out that you may need extra visa time to complete.\n\nIf you are not eligible for another CAS, you will need to make alternative arrangements for the remainder of your studies, e.g. completing your course remotely or switching to a different immigration category (if eligible). You are also welcome to\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss the time limits prior to requesting an extension."

You would therefore not need to get a Student Visa Adviser's signature on the extension form before it can be processed by the Faculty Office. Please refer to our page for\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss Nationals\n\nfor information on how to maintain your status under the EUSS and continue to be eligible to live and study in the UK.

This should also allow you to have a valid visa at the time of the awarding exam board in order to apply for the Graduate Route visa.\n\nSince the viva date is not always known in advance, the University will issue CAS that will end 4 months after your submission date to allow maximum possible time for viva as per University regulations. If you have had an academic extension, any new CAS you request will end 4 months after your new submission date.\n\nAlternatively, if viva date is known at the time of requesting CAS, you can request a CAS that has the viva date as the end date.\n\nIn all cases the UKVI should grant you extra 4 months of visa wrap-up time on top of the CAS end date.\n\nRequesting New CAS\n\nIf you are interested in having this extra time on your visa, even if you do not have an extension to your submission date, please\n\ncontact us\n\n. Please make sure that you request a new CAS before your viva in any case as you still need to have outstanding academic engagements in order to be eligible for an extension in visa sponsorship. We cannot issue a CAS for a Student visa extension if you have already had viva.\n\nWe do not advise you request this extra visa time too far in advance of finishing your studies: your submission date can shift closer to the time, which may result in repeat visa applications.\n\nAnnual leave and Working\n\nPlease visit our\n\nWorking in the UK during your Studies page\n\nfor information about working on your Student visa.\n\nY\n\nou can request annual leave for the entire time between submission and viva to work more than 20 hours per week during this period. This is in addition to the 25 working days' leave per year.\u00a0 You will be expected to stay in touch with your supervisor throughout this time. Please see the\n\nPGR student leave entitlements\n\npage for more information.\n\nIf you do not have annual leave approved by your supervisor between submission and viva, you will be limited to 20 hours per week work during that time. Students are considered as 'on leave' automatically between viva and exam board date (irrespective of their CAS end date), so can work more than 20 hours a week then.\n\nEarly Completion Report to the UKVI\n\nEarly completion of a course will be reported to the UKVI after the\n\nawarding exam board\n\nif it happens more than 30 days earlier than the CAS end date. This will adjust your visa end date and affect your ability to return to the UK if you leave the UK and re-enter around that time - for further information please see\n\nthis page\n\nand speak with Student Visa Advisers if anything is unclear.\n\nSpecific Information for Research Master's and MPhil Students\n\nResearch Master's and MPhil students would not be able to extend a visa from inside the UK and would need to apply for any additional visa from their home country if they are eligible for a new CAS. PhD and other Doctorate programme students are able to apply for a new visa from the UK as they are exempt from the\n\nAcademic Progression\n\nrequirements. Unfortunately this UKVI concession does not apply to other types of research students.\n\nIf you are an MPhil or a Research Master's student who needs extra visa time, please speak with the Student Visa Advisers about your situation in good time as you may need to arrange to go to your home country to apply for a new visa.\n\nExtending your visa for a new course\n\nTo be eligible to apply in the UK you must meet the UKVI Academic Progression requirements. Please visit our\n\nAcademic Progression webpage\n\nfor further information."

This does not need to be done immediately, but rather before your current visa runs out. Please note however that for courses at Bachelor\u2019s level you will be subject to\n\nthe 5-year time limit\n\n. If you think you are affected by this, please\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss. For MEng and MSci programmes there is currently no visa time limit.\n\nThere is an\n\nATAS requirement\n\napplicable to some MSci and MEng programmes. If your course has an ATAS requirement, you will need to apply for a new ATAS certificate with a new course end date within 28 days of being notified of the supplementary year.\n\nSupplementary Year with Attendance only in Teaching Block One or Teaching Block Two\n\nIf you are required to take a supplementary year where attendance of a taught module is required only in one teaching block (TB1 or TB2), your visa sponsorship will be interrupted at some point in the academic year. This means that during the other teaching block you are only required to take assessments but no teaching, and that your status will most likely change from Registered (R) to Exams Only (RE) at some point in the academic year, which will result in your visa sponsorship being withdrawn and you needing to apply for a new Student visa before returning to full-time studies.\n\nStudents with this academic outcome can contact Student Visa Advisers to discuss how this may affect them, but here are some common scenarios below:\n\nAttendance in Teaching Block One but not in Teaching Block Two\n\nTo be eligible to retain their visa during a supplementary year, a student must be taking at least one unit in each teaching block, and that unit must be:\n\n-\n\nthe unit that was previously failed; or\n\n- if that unit is no longer offered, an appropriate replacement unit for the original unit\n\nIf you have at least one taught module that you need to re-take in TB1, your visa sponsorship will remain active until the start of TB2 as per\n\nthis schedule\n\n.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate student - after TB1 is over the Visa Compliance team will withdraw the visa sponsorship by making a report to the UKVI as per the University's sponsorship duties. They will notify you of this by email and you will then usually have 60 days to leave the UK from that moment. You will then be expected to apply for a visa from outside the UK before returning to full-time studies the following academic year. You will need\n\nto contact Student Visa Advisers\n\nto get advice and arrange a new CAS a few months before returning to full-time studies.\n\nIf you are a postgraduate taught student - your visa will expire in January at the end of TB1.\u00a0 Therefore, you have a visa that covers you to remain in the UK for teaching in TB1 so do not need to take any visa action.\u00a0 You will need to ensure that you leave the UK before your visa expires in January.\u00a0 You cannot extend your visa to remain in the UK without further immediate in-person study.\n\nAttendance in Teaching Block Two but not in Teaching Block One\n\nTo be eligible to retain their visa during a supplementary year,\u00a0a student must be taking at least one unit in each teaching block, and that unit must be:\n\n-\u00a0the unit that was previously failed; or\n\n- if that unit is no longer offered, an appropriate replacement unit for the original unit\n\nIf you are an undergraduate student - if the unit you need to re-take falls in TB2 and you do not have any eligible units in TB1, then your current Student visa sponsorship will be interrupted in TB1 due to a break in study engagement. You will receive an email from Student Visa Compliance in TB1 notifying you that the visa sponsorship has been withdrawn and you have 60 days to leave the UK.\u00a0 This means that ordinarily you will need to travel home during those 60 days (or before) and then apply for a new visa from outside the UK to re-join the rest of your studies in TB2.\u00a0 If you are outside the UK when receiving the notification from Student Visa Compliance, please do not attempt to re-enter on the same Student visa: there is a possibility it may have lapsed due to you being outside the UK and a report being made on it at the same time.\n\nIf you are a postgraduate taught student - if the unit you need to re-take falls in TB2, you can remain in the UK during TB1 as you are in the 'wrap-up' period of your visa i.e. the 4 months after your course original end date.\u00a0 Provided you are required to be in attendance by your school/faculty for further in person study in TB2, you will be able to request a new CAS to apply for a new Student visa.\u00a0 You will need to apply for a new Student visa before your current Student visa expires if you are still in the UK.\u00a0 Alternatively, if you have travelled home during TB1 you can apply for the new visa overseas if you wish before returning to resume in person studies.\n\nResits and supplementary Year not in Attendance (Exams only)\n\nTo be eligible to retain their visa during a supplementary year, a student must be taking at least one unit in each teaching block, and that unit must be:\n\n-\u00a0the unit that was previously failed; or\n\n- if that unit is no longer offered, an appropriate replacement unit for the original unit\n\nIf you are required to do re-sits or a supplementary year without attendance, your student status will change from Registered (R) to Exams Only (RE). This means that you will not be required to be in the UK to attend lectures and workshops but will only need to attend the exams or submit assessments. It may be possible to do these remotely -\u00a0\u00a0you should contact the Faculty Office to ask if this can be arranged.\n\nIf your student status changes to Exams Only, it is the University\u2019s obligation to report this change to UKVI. Following this report, your Student visa will be curtailed (cancelled). The Student Visa Compliance team will email you and will let you know when they are about to send a report to UKVI. You will normally have 60 days from the date of our email to leave the UK.\n\nIn order to come to the UK to take your exam(s) in person, you can obtain a\n\nVisit visa\n\n. There may be some circumstances when you can apply for a short\n\nStudent visa\n\nto come back for exams - please\n\ncontact Student Visa Advisers\n\nfor further guidance on this.\n\nTo support your return to the UK on a\n\nVisit visa\n\nyou would need a Visit visa support letter, which this can be requested from your Faculty Office. This letter will state the exam dates that you are required to be in the UK.\n\nOnce you have successfully passed the exam(s) and been:\n\ngiven a final submission date for the dissertation or\n\nallowed to continue with your course on a full-time basis\n\nwe will be able to issue you with a new CAS number which will allow you to apply for a new Student visa. Please note that Visit visa holders will not be allowed to switch to a Student visa in the UK.\n\nGraduate route visa - please be aware that if you are taking your final year not in attendance this may make you ineligible for the Graduate route visa.\u00a0 If you wish to apply for the Graduate route visa, you must apply in the UK having been awarded your degree whilst holding a valid Student visa.\n\nUndergraduate students and August resits\n\nIf you are a final year undergraduate student and are taking August resits, your visa should expire in October and, therefore, you can take your resits during your existing visa period.\u00a0 You may still be able to start a new course in September as you should receive your results in time to apply for a new\n\nStudent visa\n\nand start your new course.\u00a0 You should speak to your school/faculty regarding when you will receive resits results and then the admissions team dealing with your admission to your new course regarding your admission and your new CAS to apply for your new Student visa.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate student and need to pass August resits to progress onto the next year of your current course you should receive your results in time to progress on your current course.\n\nPostgraduate students and resits\n\nIf you are taking resits during your visa period, including during your wrap-up time which is the 4 months of your visa granted after your original course end date on your CAS, the University is not obliged to report this to the UKVI so there will be no impact to your Student visa.\u00a0 This also means that because resits fall within your existing visa period you will not be eligible to apply for a new Student visa.\u00a0 You would only be eligible to apply for a new Student visa if you have resits and are then required to complete further study, following the resits e.g. dissertation, in attendance full time and your new course end date is beyond your visa expiry date.\u00a0 Please note that if there is a delay in results and they will not be published before your visa expires, it could affect your eligibility for the\n\nGraduate route visa\n\n."

        "category": "Visas & International",
        "content": "Suspending your studies\n\nIf you are suspending your studies\n\nWhen you decide to formally suspend your studies you must complete a suspension form, usually available from your School office.\n\nPostgraduate taught students and undergraduate students\n\nBefore you submit the signed suspension form back to the School, you must read the information below. If you anything is unclear, you can email us with the details of your proposed suspension, such as suspension dates and any change in anticipated course end date, on\n\nstudent-visas@bristol.ac.uk\n\nso that we can advise you on the possible immigration implications.\n\nPostgraduate research students\n\nBefore you submit the signed suspension form back to the school, please read the information below so that you are aware of the visa implications and send your form to the\n\nStudent Visa Advisers\n\nto sign with the visa advice.\n\nSuspensions of more than 60 days\n\nAs a Student visa sponsor, the University has a duty to report certain changes relating to your studies to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI). If you suspend your studies for more than 60 days, the University will withdraw your Student visa sponsorship and notify you by email. You should then receive notification from UKVI that your visa will be curtailed (shortened) to 60 days from the date of their notification.\n\nIt is difficult to predict when exactly the UKVI will send that communication, and whether it will be delivered to you reliably. We therefore strongly advise that you to leave the UK within 60 days of the University emailing you about the notification being made to the UKVI.\n\nPlease also be aware of the following:\n\nIf you leave/have left the UK during the 60-day period, it is highly likely that your remaining visa will lapse and you will also need to apply for a new visa before travelling back to the UK. If the\u00a0curtailment\u00a0is processed by the UKVI promptly, your visa will no longer be valid to enter the UK, even if the 60-day period has not yet expired.\n\nAs a suspension of more than 60 days will require you to study over a longer period in order to complete your course, please be aware of the\n\nUKVI restrictions on how long you can study in the UK\n\n. Any time on suspension will count towards your maximum study time unless your visa has been curtailed promptly.\u00a0We recommend you keep travel documentation in case you need to provide evidence you have been outside the UK while on suspension.\n\nUnfortunately the UKVI will not refund the remainder of the Immigration Health Surcharge to compensate you for any cancelled visa period. You will be required to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge, as well as the visa application fee again when you apply for a new visa to return. The calculation will run from the new visa start date until the new visa expiry date.\n\nFollowing the visa curtailment, your right to work in the UK will cease after your adjusted visa expiry date. If you were to undertake any work while you have no right to work in the UK, you would be in breach of UK immigration law, which could have serious legal implications. Your employer could also be prosecuted.\n\nSuspensions of less than 60 days\n\nIf you suspend your studies for a period of up to 60 days you will not usually need to leave the UK, provided you will be able to complete your course within your existing visa time. This can unfortunately reduce the amount of wrap-up time you will have left after your studies, which in turn can affect the\n\nGraduate Route\n\nvisa eligibility as your Student visa needs to be valid when your degree gets awarded at the exam board. Please note that\n\nit is not possible to extend your Student visa just to wait for your results and the exam board.\n\nIf your suspension means that a supplementary year would be required or your course end date is extended past your visa validity, your Student visa sponsorship will be withdrawn even if the suspension is no longer than 60 days. You will need to either leave the UK or obtain a new visa in a different category (subject to eligibility).\n\nShould you not return to studies after 60 days of absence, your Student visa sponsorship is likely to be withdrawn. Please note that 60-day maximum includes both any formal suspension you take\n\nand any absence from study immediately prior to starting the suspension. It will also include any period of annual leave taken immediately before and after the suspension.\n\nIf you are requesting a short suspension after having previously taken one on your current visa, you should\n\nspeak to a Student Visa Adviser\n\nbefore proceeding. This is because a further change in your course end date may affect your visa situation, and\n\nATAS\n\nconditions (if applicable).\n\nEmergency suspensions\n\nSuspensions that are processed as \u2018emergency suspensions\u2019 under the University\u2019s\n\nFitness to Study Policy\n\ncan affect your immigration status as a Student visa student, please see general information regarding suspensions on this webpage.\u00a0\u00a0We would also encourage you to seek advice from the Student Visa Advisers for specific advice relating to your situation and with any questions you may have at this time so that we can support and guide you.\u00a0Those on emergency suspension may be contacted directly by Student Visas to ensure that they are aware of the affect of a suspension on their Student visa.\u00a0 Given that those on emergency suspensions can include students who are unable to seek visa advice, for example those who are severely unwell or detained under the Mental Health Act, advice may be given to colleagues within the University, including the Secretary's Office, to support students at this time.\n\nSuspensions due to parental leave\n\nThere is no separate provision in the Immigration Rules and guidance to cover parental leave, so the same rules as above apply. In the case of students sponsored by the University under UKVI Student visa, suspension as a result of parental leave may require the University to withdraw sponsorship and for the student to return to their home country for the duration of the leave should the suspension exceed 60 days.\n\nIn such cases, students will thereafter need to apply to the University for a new CAS number to apply for a new visa to resume their studies. All requests for parental leave must be made in good time to permit time for approval of the request and to ensure travel home can be made following the report of the suspension to the UKVI. In all cases, advice should be sought from a\n\nStudent Visa Adviser\n\nas early as possible (especially in the case of a pregnancy) to ensure compliance with the Student visa can be maintained.\n\nReturning to study after suspension of more than 60 days\n\nGetting your Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS)\n\nWhen you have agreed a date to return to study, with your faculty/school, you should\n\nemail the Student Visa Advisers\n\nto get visa advice and request a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) request form. Student Visas can help determine whether you are eligible for a visa to continue your studies by checking:\n\nYou do not exceed the\n\nUKVI restrictions on how long you can study in the UK\n\n. Any time on suspension will count towards your maximum study time unless your visa has been curtailed (cancelled) promptly.\u00a0We recommend you keep travel documentation in case you need to provide evidence you have been outside the UK while on suspension.\n\nYou can meet the\n\nfinancial requirements\n\nfor a successful visa application.\n\nIf you need an\u00a0Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate\u00a0for your subject.\n\nIf the suspension was on medical grounds, we will not be able to issue a CAS until your return to study has received academic approval by your Faculty who will review your medical evidence and determine that are fit to return. If your continued study is still to be approved by Faculty Progress Board at the point of you requesting the CAS, any visa application you then make will be at your own risk. A CAS or a visa granted can be withdrawn if you do not progress as expected. Your\n\nfaculty office\n\nwill be able to tell you if your continued study needs to be approved by Faculty Progress Board.\n\nApplying for your visa\n\nYou should begin preparing your\n\ndocuments for your visa application\n\nin advance of receiving your CAS, in particular the\n\nfinancial evidence\n\n. You are welcome to\n\ncontact Student Visa Advisers\n\nif anything is unclear.\n\nWhen you have your CAS you can then apply for your new\n\nStudent visa\n\n.\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss Students\n\nIf you hold status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), you will need to ensure that you either continue holding a permission under the EUSS when you return to studies or that you have obtained a\n\nStudent visa\n\n. As your study would be interrupted, you should be subject to student document checks (right to study) upon return.\n\nUKCISA have a detailed webpage that covers the\n\nEU Settlement Scheme and absences from the UK\n\n. Please note that Student Visas are unable to advise on this in detail.\n\nIf you need to switch to the Student route please\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice and to request a CAS three months before you return from suspension."

The visa will be curtailed to 4 months at the point of the lower level award being made, as the lower level course takes less time than the visa was originally granted for. During these 4 months you should be able to stay in the UK and retain your Student visa conditions if you are here when the report is made. Your remaining leave may lapse if you are outside the UK during that time or leave the UK in that period of 4 months.\n\nIf you are downgrading to an MPhil or MScR from a PhD, this is not an integrated programme so you will be required to apply for a new visa at the point of transfer and will need to make the new visa application overseas.\u00a0 In changing your visa to ensure you have the correct visa for your MPhil or MScR, you will be preserving your access to the Graduate Route, as you need to have completed the course for which your CAS was issued and\u00a0the transfer does not meet one of the\n\nexceptions\n\nfor continued eligibility as it is not an integrated course.\n\nPlease\n\ncontact us\n\nif you have any questions.\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss students\n\nIf you started your current course before 1 July 2021 or if you have transferred from a course that began before 1 July 2021 (without\n\nsuspending your studies\n\n),\n\nit is assumed that you will hold a status under the EU Settlement Scheme.\u00a0 Please refer to\n\nour Brexit webpage\n\nfor information on how to maintain your status under the EUSS\u00a0and continue to be eligible to live and study in the UK."

If you started your postgraduate course in September 2023 or earlier (and all the other requirements are met), you will still be able to have dependants in the UK after January 2024.\n\nStudents\u00a0financially sponsored by the UK or an Overseas Government for full-time courses of at least six months at all academic levels will be able to bring dependants.\n\nPlease see\n\nUKCISA\n\nfor further details.\n\nEligibility\n\nNot all Student visa students can bring family to the UK as dependants. Not all family members are classified as dependants.\n\nFor eligibility, please read the\n\nUK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) guidelines on family members\n\n, or the\n\nUK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) guidelines\n\non dependants.\n\nFunding\n\nDependants must have at least \u00a3680 per month for the duration of the student's visa in the UK, for a maximum of 9 months.\n\nIf your dependant makes a new visa application in the UK and has been living in the UK with immigration permission (of any type) for 12 months or more on the date they apply, they\n\nwill not need to meet the financial requirement. If they have not been living in the UK for 12 months or more, or are applying overseas, please read the following information carefully.\n\nStudents must show funding until their course end date.\n\nDependants\u00a0must show funding until the student\u2019s course end date, plus an additional 4 months.\u00a0This is always capped at 9 months, so the maximum you will show is \u00a36120 for each dependant.\n\nIf the length of the Dependant\u00a0visa is likely to be less than 9 months, funding calculation will depend of the applicant's current immigration status and location.\u00a0Please\n\ncontact us\n\nfor more information.\n\nIf you are sponsored by your government or an official international scholarship agency, if your letter also shows the names of your dependant/s then you can use your letter for their funding evidence if the money is enough for your family unit or if they state that they cover your all living costs for all family members and your tution fees.\n\nIf a student already has their visa and the dependant/s are applying later, the dependant/s is required to show evidence of funds for themselves only as it is a separate application.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nPlease read:\n\nthe 'Student: dependants' section of the\n\nStudent and Child Student\n\ncaseworker guidance\n\nUKCISA guidance\n\nUKVI\n\nRelationship with a Partner\n\ncaseworker guidance for information on how to prove your relationship, including the 'Genuine and subsisting relationship requirement (assessing a relationship for the first time)' section which is particularly useful if you have not lived with your dependant partner for some time\n\nSuggested document checklist for dependants (PDF, 116kB)\n\nApplying outside the UK\n\nIf dependants are outside the UK, they must apply for entry clearance in their home country before they travel to the UK.\n\nIt is simpler to apply at the same time as the main applicant. The application form should make clear that the dependant(s) are accompanying the main applicant who will be studying in the UK.\n\nIf applications are not submitted at the same time as the main applicant, it is advisable to include a copy of the main applicant's student visa when the dependant(s) applies for entry clearance. The application form should make clear that the dependant(s) are accompanying the main applicant who will be studying in the UK.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApply online using\n\nthis form\n\n. You must specify if you are applying as a Partner Dependant visa - PBS or a Child Dependant visa - PBS. Each dependant must complete a separate application form.\n\nApplying inside the UK\n\nDependants must apply online. It is simpler if you and your dependants apply to extend your visas at the same time. If your dependant is not already a student dependant visa holder please check\n\nUKCISA\n\nguidance to ensure that your dependants can make their application from inside the UK.\n\nHow to apply\n\nIf you are a student/main applicant making an application at the same time as your dependants, and do not wish to/cannot use the\n\nUsing the 'UK Immigration: ID Check'\n\nto validate your application, you should fill in the online\n\nStudent visa application\n\na\n\nnd add your dependants to that online application form. \u00a0If you wish to use the\n\n'UK Immigration: ID Check'\n\nyou will need to make individual applications.\n\nThe visa application form will direct you to this option at the start of the process and determine if it is available to you, if it is not available to you, you will be directed to book and attend a biometric appointment at the end of the visa application process.\n\nIf your dependants are not applying at the same time as you, they will need to make a separate application to you online.\n\nIf a dependant partner is applying on their own, they can apply using the link found on the\n\nPBS Dependant - Partner\n\npage\n\nIf a dependant partner and a dependant child are both applying, they can apply using the link found on the\n\nPBS Dependant - Partner\n\npage; fill out the application for the dependant partner first and then add the dependant child/children to the application\n\nIf a dependant child is applying on their own, they can apply using the link found on the\n\nPBS Dependant - Child\n\npage\n\nSome student dependants must apply for their visas at the same time as the student, please see\n\nUKCISA\n\nfor details"

The possibility of continued Student visa sponsorship in these instances is assessed on a case-by-case basis\n\nAdverse immigration history and criminal convictions\n\nCertain criminal convictions and adverse immigration history, e.g. overstaying, breaching visa conditions, past visa refusals, deportations, some outstanding NHS debts etc. can prevent you from getting a Student visa as they fall under \u2018General grounds for refusal\u2019\n\nYou can read more about these under \u2018Requirements\u2019 on\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nIt is important that you declare any such events when asked about them in your visa application. Not declaring adverse immigration or criminal history to UKVI could lead to being accused of deception. Deception itself is one of the general grounds for refusal and can result in a 10-year time bar from the UK\n\nIf you think that any of the general grounds for refusal apply to you, it is in your best interest to\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice before proceeding with your application. When asked, you should always declare any such history in your application for admission or for\n\nConfirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\n\nThe University reserves the right to refuse issuing CAS to anyone who may fall under general grounds for refusal.

If you are applying for a visa to study the International Foundation Programme or a Pre-sessional course, you should have evidence of qualifications as listed on CAS ready, in case it is requested.\n\nYour visa application will be refused if you do not provide the necessary documents, in the time stated, if requested by UKVI.\n\nIf you do submit documents when they are not required, they will be assessed anyway.

If the chip is broken, or if you are unable to use the app, then you will be directed to a Visa Application Centre to enrol biometrics instead. See\n\nUsing the 'UK Immigration: ID Check' app\n\nfor\u00a0information about how to use the app on your phone\n\nAttending a Visa Application Centre (VAC)\n\nIf you cannot use the UK Immigration: ID Check app you will need to attend a VAC to enrol your biometrics.\u00a0 At the end of your visa application you will be able to book an appointment at a VAC to enrol your biometrics.\u00a0 This is part of the visa application.\u00a0 Please see the\n\ngov.uk website\n\nto find your nearest VAC\n\nVisa fees and Immigration Health Surcharge\n\nVisa fees\n\nAs part of the process you will be required to pay the visa application fee, which is currently \u00a3524 for the 3 week Standard service or you can pay the standard visa fee of \u00a3524 plus an additional \u00a3500 for the\n\nfaster premium 5 day service\n\nImmigration Health Surcharge (IHS) fees\n\nIHS fees\n\nwhen you apply for your visa you will also be required to pay\n\nthe Immigration Health Surcharge\n\n, (IHS) which is set at \u00a3776 per each year of visa and is calculated in 6-month blocks.\u00a0 As you are applying overseas please be aware that the overall amount may be more than this due to currency fluctuations.\u00a0 As the amount charged is based on visa length and not course length please note that wrap-up time granted after the CAS end date will also be included in the total e.g.\n\nIf you are studying a 1 year masters, your visa expiry date will be 4 months after the course end date so you will be charged a year and 6 months\n\nIf you are studying a 3 year undergraduate course, your visa expiry date will be 4 months after the course end date so you will be charged 3 years and 6 months\n\nIf you are studying a 4 year PhD, your visa expiry date will be 4 months after the course end date so you will be charged 4 years and 6 months\n\nPlease visit\n\nthis webpage\n\nfor information on how the UKVI calculate the IHS payments. Wrap-up time awarded after the CAS end date will be counted as well, so a student taking a 4-year PhD programme for example will be liable for 4.5 years of IHS payments upfront\n\nWhen completing the IHS payment, if you are applying for another Student visa to complete your current course please use your new CAS course start date in the 'course start date' box, not your original course start date, to ensure that the IHS is calculated correctly\n\nImmigration Health Surcharge (IHS) refunds\n\nIHS refunds\n\nWhen a new Student visa application has been made in the UK a refund may be possible if you paid IHS twice for the same period, see\n\nUKVI information about refunds\n\nas well as\n\nUKCISA\n\nboth include when refunds are paid\n\nIHS refunds for EU or Swiss nationals\n\nIf you are an EU or Swiss national you may be eligible for a refund if you have an EHIC card covering your stay.\u00a0 However, if you claim a refund it is important to note that:\n\nyou will not be able to work in the UK. This is because, if you work in the UK your EHIC card will no longer be valid as your home country will no longer be responsible for your healthcare while you\u2019re in the UK.\u00a0 If you claim a refund and then start working you will need to contact the health authority in your home country to confirm what you may be covered for and are likely to need to consider buying insurance to cover any additional healthcare required.\n\nyour medical access is limited to medically necessary treatment only\n\nyou cannot\u00a0repay the refund if you change your mind, or if your circumstances change.\n\nFor full details see\n\nImmigration health surcharge for students from the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland in the UK - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)\n\nReceiving your visa decision and travelling to the UK\n\nHow you will receive the visa decision and when your visa will start\n\nYou will receive the visa decision by email, please retain this email for future reference\n\n\u201cEntry vignettes\u201d are physical stickers attached to your passport.\u00a0For applications made overseas through a Visa Application Centre (VAC), UKVI are issuing 90-day entry vignettes until 15 July 2025.

        "content": "Academic Progression\n\nIf you have previously had a Student or a Tier 4 (General) Student visa, the University can only give you a CAS if your new course represents academic progress from your previous studies.\n\nIf you are currently in the UK with a Student/Tier 4 visa and wish to apply for a new Student visa, your eligibility to do this without leaving the UK would depend on the level of your studies, as well as on whether your current course has been successfully completed. If you have leave in a different immigration category, please\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice.\n\nSometimes when you are progressing from one programme of study to the next, you will not yet have your course results by the time you need to make a new visa application and start your new course. As long as your new programme is not at a lower level, you may still meet the academic progression requirement for applying inside the UK if you obtain a letter that says that you are \"highly likely to complete\" your current programme.\u00a0 This letter will be based on results from studies to date at the time the letter is granted, usually after the taught elements in the case of a postgraduate taught programme.\n\nPlease note that if you are relying on this letter to meet the academic progression requirement to apply for your next Student visa in the UK, any new visa granted may be cancelled if you subsequently fail to receive an award of your previous qualification.\u00a0 If you think there is a risk that you might fail/have failed the final part of your course it will be safer to apply overseas as there is no academic progression requirement if you are applying overseas.\n\nSome common scenarios concerning academic progression for Student/Tier 4 visa holders are described below.\n\nStarting a new course at a higher academic level than your previous course\n\nThis would normally represent academic progression and in most cases no extra justification is required. This is likely when you are:\n\nmoving from A-level study to an undergraduate course at university;\n\nmoving from a foundation/pathway course to an undergraduate course at university;\n\nmoving from an undergraduate course to a taught postgraduate programme;\n\nmoving from an undergraduate or postgraduate taught course to a PhD programme.\n\nYou must have completed your previous course and achieved the qualification for which you were studying in order to be eligible to apply in the UK. If some of your course results are not yet finalised, you may still be able to apply in the UK provided you are deemed to be highly likely to successfully complete the course. We would often state this on your CAS but if you are coming from another institution, we would need to see a letter from them first.\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\n\nStarting a new course at the same level as your previous course\n\nIf your new course is at the same level as the previous course, it may exceptionally be considered to represent academic progression provided at least one of the below requirements is met:\n\nthe new course relates to your previous course\n\n(it is either connected to the previous course, part of the same subject group, or involves deeper specialisation)\n\n; or\n\nyour previous and new course combined support your career aspirations.\n\nAs part of the admission application process and prior to being issued a CAS, you will be asked to provide a\u00a0written progression\u00a0statement to demonstrate how the new course you have applied for represents\u00a0academic\u00a0progression. The personal statement would need to include:\n\nYour reasons for studying another course at the same level and for choosing Bristol and that particular course\n\nWhat your career aspirations are and how both courses will help you achieve them\n\nHow the new course is similar to the previous course and how it is different\n\nWhether your previous course is successfully completed (you achieved the qualification for which your last visa was granted), or currently in progress, or not successfully completed (e.g. you withdrew from the course or you left early and were awarded a different qualification). If you did not complete your previous course, please give details\n\nWhere you intend to apply for a Student visa\n\nYou will also need to send copies of all your UK visas and previous CAS with your statement. Please note if you are not able to provide these documents and we feel we need more information to accurately assess your application we may ask your permission to contact UKVI to confirm your previous immigration history.\n\nThis information will be assessed and if\u00a0progression\u00a0is deemed to be justified and you meet the entry requirements for your course and are subsequently made an offer of study, you\u00a0may\u00a0be issued with a CAS in order to apply for a Student visa. Please note that if UKVI decide to invite you for a credibility interview as part of the application process, they may question why you wish to study two courses at the same level.\n\nYou must have completed your previous course and achieved the qualification for which you were studying in order to be eligible to apply in the UK. If some of your course results are not yet finalised, you may still be able to apply in the UK provided you are deemed to be highly likely to successfully complete the course. We would normally state this on your CAS but if you are coming from another institution, we would need to see a letter from them first.\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\n\nIf you are doing two courses back to back, e.g. starting a Master\u2019s course in September while still being registered on your previous Master\u2019s course, we strongly suggest that you wait until at least one month before the end date of your current course to make your visa application. This is because it is important that you continue holding the correct visa for the course on which you are registered.\n\nStarting a new course at a lower level than your previous course\n\nTo demonstrate academic progression, the new course must normally be above the level of the previous course for which you were given Student or Tier 4 student leave. A course at a lower level does not meet the academic progression requirements. It is unlikely that we will be able to offer a CAS supporting a course at a lower level, however in exceptional circumstances we may consider issuing a CAS for a visa application overseas as you would not be eligible to apply in the UK.\n\nIf you still wish to be considered for a CAS, as part of the admission application process you will be asked to provide a\u00a0written progression\u00a0statement to demonstrate how the new course you have applied for represents\u00a0academic\u00a0progression. The personal statement would need to include:\n\nYour reasons for studying a course at a lower level and for choosing Bristol and that particular course\n\nWhat your career aspirations are and how both courses will help you achieve them\n\nHow the new course is similar to the previous course and how is it different?\n\nWhether your previous course is successfully completed (you achieved the qualification for which your last visa was granted), or currently in progress, or not successfully completed (for example you withdrew from the course or you left early and were awarded a different qualification). If you did not complete your previous course, please give details\n\nWhere you intend to apply for a Student visa\n\nYou would also need to send copies of all your UK visas and previous CAS with your statement. Please note if you are not able to provide these documents and we feel we need more information to accurately assess your application we may ask your permission to contact UKVI to confirm your previous immigration history.\n\nThis information will be assessed and if progression is deemed to be justified and you meet the entry requirements for your course and are subsequently made an offer of study, you may be issued with a CAS in order to apply for a Student visa. You would be required to leave the UK in order to apply for a Student visa. It is likely that UKVI will invite you for a credibility interview as part of the application process as they may question why you wish to study a course that is at a lower level than your previous qualification.\n\nWho can apply for a Student visa inside the UK?\n\nIf you wish to apply in the UK, there must be no more than 28 days between your current visa end date and your new course start date.\u00a0 As well as meeting the 28 day requirement, you need to meet the following requirements.\n\nTo be eligible to apply for your visa inside the UK, you must have successfully completed the course for which you were last granted Student or Tier 4 student leave or, if you were permitted to change courses with the same sponsor, the course you changed to. In addition to that, your new course cannot be at a lower level than your previous one. There are several exceptions to the successful completion rule, listed below:\n\nYou are applying for a visa to re-sit an examination, repeat a module or take a supplementary year, or you have previously re-sat examinations, repeated modules or taken a supplementary year and require leave to remain to complete your course;\n\nYou are applying for a new visa to progress from a Bachelor\u2019s to Master\u2019s level course as part of an integrated Master\u2019s course, or a Master\u2019s to PhD level course as part of an integrated Master\u2019s and PhD programme. Please see our information about\n\nTransferring your course\n\n;\n\nYou are applying for further leave to complete the PhD or other doctoral qualification for which you were last given Student/Tier 4 student leave (including where you are completing the qualification at a new University). Please see our infomation about\n\nExtending your studies\n\n;\n\nYou are applying to extend your leave in order to undertake a study abroad programme or work placement or you have previously completed a study abroad programme or work placement and require leave to remain to complete your course. Please see our information about\n\nTransferring your course\n\n;\n\nYou are a Child Student/Tier 4 (Child) Student;\n\nYou are applying for a visa to pursue an intercalating course as part of your medical, dental or veterinary science degree, or you are returning to your original course having completed your intercalated course;\n\nYou are applying for a Student visa to undertake a role as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer, or to complete the qualification for which you were last given Tier 4/Student leave after a period as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer;\n\nYou are applying as a postgraduate doctor or dentist on a recognised Foundation Programme;\n\nYou are making a first application to complete an existing course that was commenced at a Student/Tier 4 visa Sponsor institute that had its licence revoked.\n\nIf you are not sure whether or not you meet any of the above requirements, or you hold a non-Tier 4/Student visa, please\n\ncontact us\n\nso that we can advise. Should you need to leave the UK to make a visa application, it is important to do so in good time as you would have to allow enough time to apply for and obtain your visa overseas."

        "content": "Time limits on study\n\nDepending on the level of study, there can be strict time limits on how long a student can spend holding a Student visa. Please read the information specific to each level of study below.\n\nStudying under degree level\n\nIf the course is below degree level e.g. foundation course or A-Levels, you are allowed to spend no more than 2 years on a Student visa from the age of 18. This 2-year limit does not include any time spent as a Child Student/Tier 4 (Child) when you were aged 17 years and under, Student/Tier 4 (General) when you were 16 or 17 years old or on any other non-Tier 4 or Student visa category which permits study.\n\nIf you have studied a foundation course while holding a combined Student visa for the foundation year and the main degree programme, the undergraduate degree-level time limits will apply.\n\nIf there were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely, this may represent an exception to the two-year time limit. For more information on this please see the \"How are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\" dropdown\n\nStudying at undergraduate degree level\n\nAs a rule, when studying at undergraduate degree level your time as a Student/Tier 4 student is limited to a maximum of five years. There are a few exceptions to this rule, some are listed below:\n\nYou are undertaking a course in dentistry, medicine and veterinary science\n\nYou are undertaking a course in\n\narchitecture, or\n\nmusic at a music college that is a member of Conservatoires UK. These options are not offered at the University of Bristol\n\nYou have completed a UK degree and are applying to complete certain professional law programmes, e.g. a law conversion course\n\nThere were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely. For more information on this please see the \"How are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\" dropdown\n\nStudying at postgraduate degree level\n\nThere is no visa time limit on studying postgraduate courses at RQF level 7 and above. This includes Master's degrees, integrated undergraduate + Master's degrees (e.g. MEng and MSci), MPhil and MRes, PhD and other doctorate qualifications.\n\nHow are time limits calculated and can they be exceeded?\n\nYour time limit is calculated based on the length of visas granted to you and not duration of courses studied. The UKVI will consider how much leave you have already received to study courses as a Student/Tier 4 (General) holder and add the length of leave that you will receive if your current application is granted. Any additional time before and after any course is counted, as well as time spent outside the UK and on vacation.\n\nIf you have previously studied in the UK, the University will assess whether or not you are likely to exceed the time limit before issuing you a CAS. It is therefore very important that you declare all the previous courses you have studied and all the Student visas you have held in your application for admission. You are also welcome to\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss the time limits prior to this stage.\n\nIf you are a current University of Bristol student and require an academic extension that will take you over the relevant time limit, the University will not generally be able to issue you a CAS for this.\n\nIn some cases where\n\nthere were exceptional compelling and compassionate circumstances that either prevented you from completing the course within the time given or caused you to leave the course prematurely, the University may be able to exceptionally issue a CAS for an extra year of study\n\n. An example of such circumstances would be a documented serious illness or injury during your studies. If this applies to you, please\n\ncontact us\n\nas soon as you find out that you may need extra visa time to complete.\n\nIf you are not eligible for another CAS, you will need to make alternative arrangements for the remainder of your studies, e.g. completing your course remotely or switching to a different immigration category (if eligible). You are also welcome to\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss the time limits prior to requesting an extension."

Therefore, whether you will be eligible for the graduate visa will depend on whether or not you can apply for a new Student visa and/or be awarded within your Student visa validity. Please see our website for further information regarding the\n\nGraduate route visa\n\nATAS\n\n- if you currently have an ATAS for your studies and extend your course by more than 3 months and/or need to apply for a new Student visa you will need to apply for a new ATAS certificate. Please see our\n\nAcademic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\n\npage\n\nfor information on how to apply.\n\nExtending your visa for your current course\n\nYou may need to extend your visa to complete your studies.\n\nSpeak to your faculty or school to find out if it is possible to extend your studies.\n\nChanges to your student status will affect your immigration status.\n\nIf the faculty or school are happy for you to continue your studies, you will need to take an extension form\u00a0and\n\ncontact us\n\nto discuss.\n\nOur advisers will tell you if you are eligible to extend your visa to stay in the UK to complete your studies.\n\nThe form will confirm you have had immigration advice before extending your studies.\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss students\n\nIf you started your current course at the University on 1 July 2021 or after, you would need to get a Student Visa Adviser's signature on the extension form before it can be processed by the Faculty Office.\n\nIf you started your current course or, if you transferred, a course you transferred from, before 1 July 2021, it is assumed that you hold a status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS). You would therefore not need to get a Student Visa Adviser's signature on the extension form before it can be processed by the Faculty Office. Please refer to our page for\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss Nationals\n\nfor information on how to maintain your status under the EUSS and continue to be eligible to live and study in the UK. You are welcome to\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice if you have any doubts.\n\nPGR students\n\nThis section covers information specific to postgraduate research students extending their submission date and requesting extra visa time.\n\nCAS and Visa Expiry Date\n\nIf you are a PGR student who has to have a viva as part of your studies, you can request a longer CAS that would cover your viva and allow extra visa wrap-up time after the viva. This should also allow you to have a valid visa at the time of the awarding exam board in order to apply for the Graduate Route visa.\n\nSince the viva date is not always known in advance, the University will issue CAS that will end 4 months after your submission date to allow maximum possible time for viva as per University regulations. If you have had an academic extension, any new CAS you request will end 4 months after your new submission date.\n\nAlternatively, if viva date is known at the time of requesting CAS, you can request a CAS that has the viva date as the end date.\n\nIn all cases the UKVI should grant you extra 4 months of visa wrap-up time on top of the CAS end date.\n\nRequesting New CAS\n\nIf you are interested in having this extra time on your visa, even if you do not have an extension to your submission date, please\n\ncontact us\n\n. Please make sure that you request a new CAS before your viva in any case as you still need to have outstanding academic engagements in order to be eligible for an extension in visa sponsorship. We cannot issue a CAS for a Student visa extension if you have already had viva.\n\nWe do not advise you request this extra visa time too far in advance of finishing your studies: your submission date can shift closer to the time, which may result in repeat visa applications.\n\nAnnual leave and Working\n\nPlease visit our\n\nWorking in the UK during your Studies page\n\nfor information about working on your Student visa.\n\nY\n\nou can request annual leave for the entire time between submission and viva to work more than 20 hours per week during this period. This is in addition to the 25 working days' leave per year.\u00a0 You will be expected to stay in touch with your supervisor throughout this time. Please see the\n\nPGR student leave entitlements\n\npage for more information.\n\nIf you do not have annual leave approved by your supervisor between submission and viva, you will be limited to 20 hours per week work during that time. Students are considered as 'on leave' automatically between viva and exam board date (irrespective of their CAS end date), so can work more than 20 hours a week then.\n\nEarly Completion Report to the UKVI\n\nEarly completion of a course will be reported to the UKVI after the\n\nawarding exam board\n\nif it happens more than 30 days earlier than the CAS end date. This will adjust your visa end date and affect your ability to return to the UK if you leave the UK and re-enter around that time - for further information please see\n\nthis page\n\nand speak with Student Visa Advisers if anything is unclear.\n\nSpecific Information for Research Master's and MPhil Students\n\nResearch Master's and MPhil students would not be able to extend a visa from inside the UK and would need to apply for any additional visa from their home country if they are eligible for a new CAS. PhD and other Doctorate programme students are able to apply for a new visa from the UK as they are exempt from the\n\nAcademic Progression\n\nrequirements. Unfortunately this UKVI concession does not apply to other types of research students.\n\nIf you are an MPhil or a Research Master's student who needs extra visa time, please speak with the Student Visa Advisers about your situation in good time as you may need to arrange to go to your home country to apply for a new visa.\n\nExtending your visa for a new course\n\nTo be eligible to apply in the UK you must meet the UKVI Academic Progression requirements. Please visit our\n\nAcademic Progression webpage\n\nfor further information."

The visa will be curtailed to 4 months at the point of the lower level award being made, as the lower level course takes less time than the visa was originally granted for. During these 4 months you should be able to stay in the UK and retain your Student visa conditions if you are here when the report is made. Your remaining leave may lapse if you are outside the UK during that time or leave the UK in that period of 4 months.\n\nIf you are downgrading to an MPhil or MScR from a PhD, this is not an integrated programme so you will be required to apply for a new visa at the point of transfer and will need to make the new visa application overseas.\u00a0 In changing your visa to ensure you have the correct visa for your MPhil or MScR, you will be preserving your access to the Graduate Route, as you need to have completed the course for which your CAS was issued and\u00a0the transfer does not meet one of the\n\nexceptions\n\nfor continued eligibility as it is not an integrated course.\n\nPlease\n\ncontact us\n\nif you have any questions.\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss students\n\nIf you started your current course before 1 July 2021 or if you have transferred from a course that began before 1 July 2021 (without\n\nsuspending your studies\n\n),\n\nit is assumed that you will hold a status under the EU Settlement Scheme.\u00a0 Please refer to\n\nour Brexit webpage\n\nfor information on how to maintain your status under the EUSS\u00a0and continue to be eligible to live and study in the UK."

You must specify if you are applying as a Partner Dependant visa - PBS or a Child Dependant visa - PBS.

To achieve academic success most students will need to engage fully; studying and attending lectures, seminars, tutorials, and labs/workshops provides opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully achieve the outcomes of our taught programmes. Non-engagement can be an indicator that a student is not thriving academically or personally and for international students with a Tier 4/Student visa, engagement monitoring is essential to ensure visa compliance.\n\n2. As part of our duties as a Student visa sponsor, we are required to monitor your engagement with your course of study to ensure you are actively and consistently following your course.\n\nYou are required to be regularly attending on campus in-person activity.\n\nPlease see the following examples of academic activities we will be monitoring; this list is not exhaustive:\n\nAttending required lectures, seminars or tutorials\n\nUndertaking required laboratory work\n\nUndertaking research or fieldwork\n\nSubmitting essays, assignments and attending examinations\n\n3. Our aim is to provide you with academic and pastoral support so that you can complete your studies successfully. If you are experiencing any difficulties, you should speak with your supervisor or personal tutor as soon as possible so that they can help you resolve any issues. Should you fail to engage in your course or be absent from studies without permission for an extended period of time, we\n\nmay be required\n\nto inform UKVI. This can result in your visa being cancelled.\n\n4. We monitor attendance and engagement for all students, please see the\n\nAttendance Monitoring webpage\n\nfor more information.\n\n5.

Some supplementary study is permitted as outlined in the\n\nStudent visa Guidance\n\nunder 'Supplementary courses'\n\nSupplementary study should not negatively impact academic progress on your main course of study\n\nStudents should not be registered on two full-time programmes at the same time. This could be seen as studying a without valid immigration permission and breaking your visa conditions\n\nIf you are planning to start a course with a different sponsor before completing your course at Bristol, it is important that you\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice in timely manner. Depending on the timeline, it may not be possible to remain registered at the University of Bristol after you have secured a visa with a different Student visa sponsor\n\nIf you wish to start a course with us before finishing your pervious programme of study, it is important that you\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice in timely manner. We can help you determine a correct timeline for your new visa application that would not break your Student visa leave conditions\n\nOverstaying\n\nOverstaying is a breach of immigration law and is considered to be a criminal offence. There is no \u2018grace period\u2019 when it comes to overstaying. If you overstay your visa, it is in your best interest to leave the UK as soon as possible: the length of time you overstay by would affect the likelihood of being granted a UK visa in future\n\nOverstaying falls under\n\nGeneral grounds for refusal\n\n. You can learn more about these under \u2018Requirements\u2019 on\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nAny periods of overstaying would need to be declared in all future UK visa applications. You may subject to a time bar from the UK, depending on how long you have overstayed by, which is why we would urge you to\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice as soon as possible if you think you may be affected by this. If you do not declare overstaying to UKVI, you may be accused of deception, which can lead to an even longer time bar\n\nDepending on the circumstances and the length of time you overstayed by, the University may not be able to sponsor you for another\n\nConfirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\n\nin future. The possibility of continued Student visa sponsorship in these instances is assessed on a case-by-case basis\n\nAdverse immigration history and criminal convictions\n\nCertain criminal convictions and adverse immigration history, e.g. overstaying, breaching visa conditions, past visa refusals, deportations, some outstanding NHS debts etc. can prevent you from getting a Student visa as they fall under \u2018General grounds for refusal\u2019\n\nYou can read more about these under \u2018Requirements\u2019 on\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nIt is important that you declare any such events when asked about them in your visa application. Not declaring adverse immigration or criminal history to UKVI could lead to being accused of deception. Deception itself is one of the general grounds for refusal and can result in a 10-year time bar from the UK\n\nIf you think that any of the general grounds for refusal apply to you, it is in your best interest to\n\ncontact us\n\nfor advice before proceeding with your application. When asked, you should always declare any such history in your application for admission or for\n\nConfirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\n\nThe University reserves the right to refuse issuing CAS to anyone who may fall under general grounds for refusal. This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis"

        "content": "Working in the UK during your studies\n\nInternational students who hold a Student/Tier 4 student visa to study in the UK are subject to working restrictions imposed by UKVI (UK Visas & Immigration). Your eVisa\u00a0or vignette indicates the maximum number of hours you can work during term-time. This includes both paid and voluntary work. All students are prohibited from engaging in business and from self-employment, nor are they allowed to provide services as a professional sportsperson or entertainer. You can find further information on\n\nthe UKCISA webpages\n\nand on the\n\nUKCISA blog for students 'Navigating work and study with a Student visa'\n\n.\n\nBreaching any of these conditions and taking up work where you do not have the appropriate permission is considered illegal working and may affect your immigration record and have other serious consequences. Please read the \u201cWhat are the risks should a student work in excess of their conditions?\u201d section lower down to learn more.\n\nIf you are an EU or Swiss national who has claimed an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) refund you are not able to work in the UK. This is because, if you work in the UK your EHIC card will no longer be valid as your home country will no longer be responsible for your healthcare while you\u2019re in the UK.\u00a0 If you claim a refund and then start working you will need to contact the health authority in your home country to confirm what you may be covered for and are likely to need to consider buying insurance to cover any additional healthcare required. You cannot repay the refund if you change your mind, or if your circumstances change.\u00a0For full details please see\n\nImmigration health surcharge for students from the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland in the UK - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)\n\nStudent/Tier 4 visa students and working for the University - compliance with UKVI restrictions\n\nIf you take casual employment at the University of Bristol you will be employed through the\n\nTemporary Staffing Service\n\n(TSS). TSS will\u00a0assess all students' right to take up a work assignment and document it appropriately.\n\nYou are allowed to work in the UK if:\n\nYour eVisa or vignette in passport states 'Work 10hrs max in term-time' or 'Work 20hrs max in term-time', or;\n\nYour eVisa states 'Restricted Work, no work as a sportsperson\u2019 (usually appears on Dependant eVisas), or;\n\nYou are from the EU/EEA/Switzerland, and you have a settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme\n\nYou have immigration permission in a different category that allows you to work in the UK\n\nWorking limits for Student/Tier 4 visa students\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nYour eVisa should state 20 hours per week, during term-time. If it does not, this is likely to be an error \u2013 we can advise you how to correct this. The 20-hour limit would apply to all the jobs you may be doing, including unpaid/voluntary work.\n\nOur website shows the\n\nterm dates\n\nIf you are a returning student you are able to work full time during Welcome week.\u00a0 If you are a new student you will need to work a maximum of 20 hours a week during Welcome week.\u00a0 It is not possible for any student to work full time during consolidation weeks, assessment preparation weeks or in the period between the end of assessment periods and the start of vacations.\n\nAs an undergraduate student you can work full-time:\n\nduring the University vacation dates as per\n\nthe Dates webpage\n\n.\n\nafter the course end date stated in your most recent CAS if you have finished your studies\n\nduring the\n\nofficial vacation dates\n\nand after your course end date if you have finished studies\n\nPlease note that the University\u2019s Temporary Staffing Service guidelines recommend only 15 hours per week, during term-time.\n\nVolunteering is not subject to the 20-hour time limit. There is a distinction between unpaid/voluntary work and volunteering. Please visit\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nfor clarification. Most unpaid internships would be regarded as voluntary work rather than volunteering.\n\nPostgraduate Taught Students\n\nYour eVisa should state 20 hours per week, during term-time. If it does not, this is likely to be an error \u2013 we can advise you how to correct this. The 20-hour limit would apply to all the jobs you may be doing, including unpaid/voluntary work.\n\nOur website shows the\n\nterm dates\n\nIf you are a returning student you are able to work full time during Welcome week.\u00a0 If you are a new student you will need to work a maximum of 20 hours a week during Welcome week.\u00a0 It is not possible for any student to work full time during consolidation weeks, assessment preparation weeks or in the period between the end of assessment periods and the start of vacations.\n\nAs a postgraduate taught student you can work full-time during the Easter and Christmas University vacations as per\n\nthe Dates webpage\n\n. Summer holidays do not apply to postgraduate taught students as that is considered term-time when you work on your final project. You therefore must keep to the 20-hour limit during the summer months.\n\nWorking after studies, you can work full-time after both your submission date and CAS end date have passed. This means that i) if you submit later than your CAS end date e.g. because you have had an academic extension, you must wait until after your submission date to work full time and ii) if you submit before your CAS end date you will have to wait until your CAS end date has passed to be able to work full time.\n\nPlease note that the University\u2019s Temporary Staffing Service guidelines recommend only 15 hours per week, during term-time.\n\nVolunteering is not subject to the 20-hour time limit. There is a distinction between unpaid/voluntary work and volunteering. Please visit\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nfor clarification.

If it does not, this is likely to be an error \u2013 we can advise you how to correct this. The 20-hour limit would apply to all the jobs you may be doing, including unpaid/voluntary work.\n\nAs postgraduate research student you would get the same holiday allowance as University staff rather than as taught degree students. You get 25 working days of annual leave a year plus closure dates as defined on\n\nthe University\u2019s Dates website\n\nunder \u201cUniversity closure days (CD) and bank holidays (BH)\u201d. Summer holidays, and extended Easter and Christmas breaks under \u2018Key Academic Dates\u2019 do not apply to you.\n\nThis means that you can only work full-time during any complete closure weeks (Monday to Sunday) and during annual leave arranged with your supervisor as per the PGR annual leave policy. Any leave taken will have to be full calendar weeks (5 working days) in order for the limit to not apply.\n\nIt is also possible to combine the closure days with annual leave to make a whole week\u2019s holiday. For example, Easter Monday is a Bank Holiday, followed by a University Closure day on the Tuesday. You can arrange 3 days\u2019 annual leave on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and work more than 20 hours a week during that whole week.\n\nWorking after studies, you can work full-time after your viva.\n\nYou can request leave for the entire time between submission and viva to work more than 20 hours per week during this period. This is in addition to the 25 working days' leave per year.\u00a0 You will be expected to stay in touch with your supervisor throughout this time. Please see this page for more information\n\nPGR student leave entitlements | Academic Quality and Policy Office | University of Bristol\n\n. Please see our website for details on\n\nhow to request this leave\n\nPlease notify us by email once you have received academic approval for annual leave\n\nstudent-visas@bristol.ac.uk\n\nIf you do not have annual leave approved by your supervisor between submission and viva, you will be limited to 20 hours per week work during that time. Students are considered as 'on leave' automatically between viva and exam board date (irrespective of their CAS end date), so can work more than 20 hours then.\n\nPlease note that the University\u2019s Temporary Staffing Service guidelines recommend only 15 hours per week, during term-time.\n\nVolunteering is not subject to the 20-hour time limit. There is a distinction between unpaid/voluntary work and volunteering. Please visit\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nfor clarification. Most unpaid internships would be regarded as voluntary work rather than volunteering.\n\nInternational Foundation Students\n\nYour eVisa should state 10 hours per week, during term-time. If it does not, this is likely to be an error \u2013 we can advise you how to correct this to comply with your visa conditions. The 10-hour limit would apply to all the jobs you may be doing, including unpaid/voluntary work.\n\nIt is not possible for any student to work full time during consolidation weeks, assessment preparation weeks or in the period between the end of assessment periods and the start of vacations.\n\nAs an International Foundation student you can work full-time during the University holidays as per\n\nthe Dates webpage\n\n. You can also work full-time after the course end date stated in your most recent CAS if you have finished your studies.\n\nVolunteering is not subject to the 10-hour time limit. There is a distinction between unpaid/voluntary work and volunteering. Please visit\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nfor clarification. Most unpaid internships would be regarded as voluntary work rather than volunteering.\n\nPre-sessional students\n\nYour eVisa should state 10 hours per week, during term-time. If it does not, this is likely to be an error \u2013 we can advise you how to correct this to comply with your visa conditions. The 10-hour limit would apply to all the jobs you may be doing, including unpaid/voluntary work.\n\nAs an Pre-sessional student you can work full-time during the University holidays as per\n\nthe Dates webpage\n\n. You can also work full-time after the course end date stated in your most recent CAS if you have finished your studies.\n\nVolunteering is not subject to the 10-hour time limit. There is a distinction between unpaid/voluntary work and volunteering. Please visit\n\nthis UKCISA webpage\n\nfor clarification. Most unpaid internships would be regarded as voluntary work rather than volunteering.\n\nPlease note that the 20 or 10 hour per week limitations are\n\nper week\n\n\u2013 the periods worked cannot be averaged over a month or any other period. This limitation exists for both work within the University and for outside organisations, so employers of visa students should also remind those students of these restrictions if aware of work undertaken outside of the University. The permitted number of hours must fit into a 7 day period starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday.\n\nWhat types of work are allowed under Student/Tier 4 visa?\n\nThere are various types of work, such as paid and unpaid work; paid and unpaid work placements undertaken as part of a course of study or period of study; self-employment; and engaging in business activity.\n\nAs a Tier 4/Student visa holder the types of work you can undertake are restricted to paid and unpaid work as an employee of a company/organisation; and paid and unpaid work placements undertaken as part of a course of study or period of study. Student/Tier 4 students are prohibited from self-employment; and engaging in business activity, nor are they allowed to provide services as a professional sportsperson (including a sports coach) or entertainer.\n\nWorking on a contracting basis can be considered self- employment.\n\nThis government page\n\nprovides some information on the subject.\n\nAs the way people work is evolving, there are certain activities that do not fit into the traditional categories described above. We recommend you read and read UKCISA\u2019s\n\nBlog: A working definition\n\nas it addresses a range of non-standard scenarios, including working while not physically in the UK.\n\nOfficial Work Placements\n\nPaid and unpaid work placements undertaken as part of a course of study are separate from paid or unpaid employment, so can be done simultaneously. A student can therefore work up to 20 hours per week in casual employment with an employer outside of their placement, whilst on a work placement that is an assessed, integral part of a course.\n\nA work placement that is an integral and assessed part of a course is usually organised through the University and reported to the UKVI as an official placement by the Student Visa Compliance team. This is usually, but not always, a placement undertaken as part of a Year in Industry, or as part of degree in Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary medicine. Provided the placement is reported to the UKVI, such work is not subject to the limit on the number hours as it is then considered to be part of your course.\n\nWhat are the risks should a student work in excess of their conditions?\n\nIf a student is found to be in breach of their working conditions, the student could be subject to curtailment of their visa and deportation, which has happened in the past for students at other institutions. It is also a criminal offence for students to exceed their working hours and an employer can be fined, so the implications can be very serious.\n\nIf the University becomes aware of a breach in working hours, we would need to make an assessment as to whether to continue to sponsor the student\u2019s Student/Tier 4 visa. If you disclose any details to us that lead us to believe that you have broken the conditions of your visa, the University also has the obligation to report this to UKVI as this is one of our duties as a Student/Tier 4 visa Sponsor. Please read our\n\nStudent visa essential information\n\npage for further details.\n\nWhat can affect a student's working permissions?\n\nSuspension and Withdrawal\n\nShould a student withdraw from their course or suspend their studies for longer than 60 days, our sponsorship of that student would cease and the student's visa will eventually be cancelled by the UKVI. The UKVI will usually shorten the visa to 60 days from the date the process the University's notification. The right to work in the UK will cease after the adjusted visa expiry date. As the UKVI do not always serve the notice in a reliable way, it is not always possible to tell when exactly the visa will expire in these cases. It would therefore be safest to stop working 60 days after you receive the reporting email from the Student Visa Compliance team as the UKVI may action the cancellation at that point.\n\nEarly Completion of the Course\n\nA student who has successfully completed their course early and is reported as an early completer to the UKVI by the Student Visa Compliance team retains the right to work for the relevant length of time following their course completion (usually four months). If you are completing your studies early but the qualification is not the one your CAS was issued for, please contact us to find out how this may impact your working conditions.\n\nExtending your Course End Date\n\nIf your course end date is extended past the date that was stated in your CAS, we strongly advise that you do not exceed your term-time working limit (20 or 10 hours). You will still be considered as being in term-time, especially if your registration status is \u2018Registered\u2019. If after finishing studies you learn that you will have an extension/resubmission/major corrections or any other academic event that will extend your course end date, we advise you observe the term-time working limit as soon as you find out about this. You should not exceed the working hours limit if you have been issued a new CAS to extend your Student visa, as the University is sponsoring you for a visa, which implies you are a full-time student in term-time.\n\nStudents in the UK on a Visitor visa\n\nYou cannot undertake any work whatsoever, whether paid, unpaid or voluntary. This includes work placements, which are not allowed even if part of your course.\n\nFurther information\n\nVisit the\n\nUK Council for International Student Affairs website\n\nfor further details and read their\n\nBlog: A working definition\n\nRead the\n\nHome Office Employer's Guide to Right to Work checks\n\nTo apply for a National Insurance Number, please visit\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number\n\nContact our\n\nCareers Service\n\nif you require help with finding a job\n\nIf you are concerned about labour exploitation or modern day slavery, for yourself or someone else, please see this link:\n\nhttps://www.gla.gov.uk/who-we-are/modern-slavery/who-we-are-modern-slavery-spot-the-signs"

Ultimately it was not to be after a 1-1 draw and we lost to a sudden-death shootout to Surbiton. Nevertheless this cannot take anything from an incredible achievement and a superb year for our squads.\u200c\n\nOur Values and Behaviours\n\nB\n\nrilliant -\n\nWe will be creative and try things without fear.

A member of UBHC will have access to a further 2 x 1.5 hour club training sessions per week in terms 1 to 2 plus pre-season, thus adding potential for c.80 hours of training plus up to 22 games per season.\n\nCompetition Provision\n\nCompetition dates shall be in line with the England Hockey\u00a0centralised\u00a0calendar, of which we have set \u2018reserved\u2019 15 competition days which includes the Talent Academy Festival in\u00a0July (3 days).\n\nThese dates will be published to the squad via the Talent Academy monthly newsletter and posted on the Talent Academy Teamo account.\n\nMembership and Costs\n\nThe cost of the Talent Academy is \u00a3899 per year payable via monthly direct debit through our\n\nSEH portal\n\n.\n\nWith this cost, Talent Academy athletes will participate in 260 hours (130 per gender) of hockey delivery hours.\n\nFor full details relating to payment of the programme please see our Sport, Exercise and Health\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nwith Section 1 Clause 4 and 5 covering payments and cancellation respectively.\n\nClub Hockey Pathway\n\nAthletes attending the Talent Academy shall not be required to\n\nrepresent\n\nthe University of Bristol Hockey Club (UBHC)\n\n.\n\nThe hockey club and Talent Academy entities will be separated but connected with the aim that young\n\npeople\n\nfeel supported\n\nand\n\nnot pressed when it comes to choosing their hockey environments. However, where\n\nappropriate\n\n(\n\nand subject to discussion)\n\n, the\n\npathway\n\nfor young people to join UBHC will be available as it is today.\n\nUBHC shall remain student-\n\ncentred\n\n, allowing the Bristol Hockey Talent Academy to act \u2018independently\u2019 of a club, allowing young players and their parents a \u2018clearer\n\n\u2019,\n\nsimpler choice when choosing to work with us, focused\n\naround\n\ntheir development and what is right for them.\n\nPlayers shall not be required to \u2018leave\u2019 their home clubs and may continue to partake in junior and senior hockey within those environments. Players aspiring to higher levels of hockey where this does not exist within their home clubs may be offered this wit\n\nh\n\nUBHC or may be supported to find the right level of hockey within other positive coaching environments.\n\nClub Purpose and Aspirations\n\nThe University of Bristol Hockey Club (UBHC) is one of the University\n\n\u2019\n\ns largest and most successful clubs. With\n\nnearly 400\n\nmembers and 13 teams (7 Ladies,\n\n6 Men\n\n\u2019\n\ns), there is an environment for everyone who\n\nwants to play hockey during their time at Bristol. UBHC consistently ranks in the Top 10 University hockey clubs in the country.\n\nUBHC has gone from strength to strength in recent years, attracting high quality people, players and coaches. There are\n\na number of\n\nprofessional coaches in place, led by our Head Coach who oversees both Men\n\n\u2019\n\ns & Ladi\n\nes\u2019\n\npr\n\nogrammes\n\n.\n\nOur University of Bristol\n\nMens\n\n1st team plays in the England Hockey Conference West, with a\n\nn\n\nambition to return to Division One experienced in the 2022/23 season. Our Women\u2019s 1st team is an ambitious West Premier League (W) team, having had two recent stints in\n\nEngland\n\nHockey Conference West.\n\nUBHC already has\n\na track record\n\nof supporting some of our area\n\n\u2019\n\ns highest potential young players, already working with schools and clubs to\n\nprovide\n\nstretch, a challenging but welcoming environment and a focus on personal development, irrespective of\n\nwhether or not\n\na young person plays for the club.\n\nTwo of the current England U18 squad and one current England U16 have trained or played with the squad in the last 5 years. The club is currently supporting a total of 4 members, male and female, who would nominally be eligible for Talent Academy selection, who have chosen to play for the club. In\n\naddition\n\nthe club continues to welcome other young people into training sessions on an ad-hoc basis where\n\nappropriate\n\n.\n\nRight Athlete Right Environment\n\nAs coaches, we exist to support those we work\n\nwith\n\nand our connections\n\nprovide\n\nus\n\nthe energy to\n\nprovide\n\nmore opportunity\n\n.\n\nThrough the Talent Academy, we are looking to\n\nprovide\n\nmore opportunity for young players in the Bristol area to train and play at a high\n\nstandard within the area and in an environment that truly supports their\n\ninterests above all\n\n."

You can show the bank that you are fully registered using a bank letter.\n\nYou can\u202fproduce your bank letter yourself.\n\nIt can sometimes take two weeks or more to open a bank account. Plan your finances to take this into account.\n\nBenefits of having a UK bank account\n\nIf you receive a University of Bristol scholarship to help with your living costs, you need a UK bank account for it to be paid into.\n\nIt will make accessing money easier and safer.\n\nYou will not be charged transaction fees when withdrawing cash.\n\nIt may be easier to pay for some UK-based services, such as mobile phone contracts.\n\nIt is more secure to withdraw small amounts of cash than to bring a large sum and keep it in your accommodation. We strongly advise against this.\n\nUsing a bank card to make purchases is the most common way to make payments in the University and the UK. Some retailers and outlets do not accept payment in cash.\n\nChoose your bank\n\nBanks have different processes for opening an account. They may require different documents and have different eligibility rules.\n\nThe University is impartial and cannot advise students on the best bank to open an account with.\n\nYou must do your research and make a decision about which bank account will best suit your needs. Our\n\nStudent bank accounts\n\npage has more information.\n\nYour chosen bank or branch is not on the list\n\nIf the bank you have chosen or your chosen branch is not on the list to produce a bank letter, contact\n\nstudent-services@bristol.ac.uk\n\nfor help.\n\nYou must:\n\nsay which bank you would like the letter addressed to\n\nprovide the full address of the branch.\n\nBefore you can produce a bank letter\n\nTo open an account, most banks require a bank letter from the University to prove you are a student with us.\u202f To produce your own bank letter online, there are steps you must follow.\n\nComplete registration\n\nYou must be\n\nfully registered\n\nbefore you can produce\u202fa bank letter.\n\nCheck your name appears correctly\n\nAs part of the registration process, you must check that your name appears correctly on your student record. You can\n\nlog into\u202fStudentInfo\n\nto check how your name is recorded.\n\nIf you need to make changes to your name,\n\ncontact your Faculty\n\n.\n\nUpdate your home and Bristol address details online\n\nYour\u202fletter will take your home and Bristol address details direct from\u202fStudentInfo.\n\nPlease double check that your home address (in your home country) is correct. You can\n\ncheck and update\n\nyour details on StudentInfo.\n\nHow to\u00a0produce your bank letter\n\nOnce you have fully registered and your details are correct, you can\u00a0produce your bank letter. You can\u00a0produce a maximum of three copies of your bank letter.\n\nProduce your bank letter\n\nIf there is incorrect or missing information displayed on your bank letter, check your personal details have been\n\nupdated on StudentInfo\n\n.\u00a0 If the information is correct on StudentInfo but incorrect in your letter, contact your\n\nFaculty Office\n\n.\n\nYour letter is a PDF document which can be downloaded. Your chosen bank will let you know if they can accept an electronic version, or if you need to print out a copy of the PDF.\n\nGiving your address\n\nMost banks will ask you to fill out an online application form to open a bank account. Make sure that the address visible on your bank letter, and address you put in your bank account application appear in the same format.\n\nExample of formatting:\n\n[Flat number, Room number]\n\n[Building name]\n\n[Building number, Street]\n\n[Town or City]\n\n[Postcode]\n\nProblems producing your bank letter\n\nContact\n\nstudent-services@bristol.ac.uk\n\nfor help if:\n\nyou have problems producing your bank letter\n\nyou have already produced three bank letters and need another one."

        "content": "History of the University\n\nOrigins of the University\n\nBefore the University of Bristol, there was University College, Bristol, which existed from 1876 to 1909.\n\nIts history can be traced back to the efforts of John Percival, headmaster of Clifton College, to press for the establishment of such an institution. In 1872, Percival wrote to the Oxford colleges observing that the provinces lacked a university culture.\n\nThe following year he produced a pamphlet called 'The Connection of the Universities and the Great Towns', which was well received by Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol College, Oxford. Jowett was to become a significant figure, both philosophically and financially, in the establishment of University College, Bristol.\n\nIn June 1874, a meeting took place at Bristol's Victoria Rooms 'to promote a School of Science and Literature for the West of England'. Percival and Jowett spoke at the meeting, and won the support of Albert Fry and Lewis Fry, members of an influential and affluent local family.\n\nUniversity College opens\n\nUniversity College, Bristol finally opened its doors at 9 am on Tuesday 10 October 1876 in rented premises at 32 Park Row. Initially there were two professors and five lecturers offering courses in 15 subjects. The College was open to men and women on the same basis (except in medicine).\n\nDuring the first session, 99 day students registered (30 men and 69 women) and 238 evening ones (143 men and 95 women).\n\nAlfred Marshall, a groundbreaking economist, served as Principal of the College until 1881. He taught evening classes while his wife, Mary Paley, the first woman lecturer, taught during the day.\n\nHer fee was deducted from her husband's salary. The second Principal was William Ramsay, discoverer of the so-called noble gases.\n\nHe left in 1887 (and received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1904), but remained influential in the College's efforts to become a university with its own Royal Charter.\n\nHis successor was Conwy Lloyd Morgan, a geologist and zoologist who also became a pioneering experimental psychologist.\n\nHe, too, was closely involved in the campaign for full university status, and would eventually become the University of Bristol's first Vice-Chancellor.\n\nFor University College, Bristol, life was a financial struggle, although in 1890 it received a \u00a32,000 boost from the local Technical Instruction Committee.\n\nThere was more good news in 1893 when the Bristol Medical School, which had been created in 1833, was formally incorporated into the College.\n\nFurther encouragement came in 1896, when Commissioners from the Treasury reported that 'there is evidently vigorous life in the place, and the work done is of the University type'.\n\nThe foundation of the University College Colston Society in 1899 was another highly significant development, drawing a broad spectrum of influential figures into supporting the College.\n\nThe campaign for University status\n\nThe campaign for a Charter gained momentum in 1904 with the appointment of Morris Travers as Professor of Chemistry. Travers, who had been recommended for the job by former Principal, William Ramsay, was an energetic and decisive man who set about gaining financial and political support for Bristol's plans.\n\nHe was backed by some powerful individuals, including Lewis Fry, Chairman of the College Council, R B (later Lord) Haldane and members of the Wills family.\n\nBy 1906, Lewis Fry felt ready to put the plan to promote a university for Bristol on a formal footing, and an executive committee was formed.\n\nHowever, problems continued - Travers left to direct a research institute in India that year, and it proved very difficult to lift the College's endowment above the total of \u00a330,000 that had been donated by members of the Wills and Fry families.\n\nEverything changed on 14 January 1908, when HO Wills promised to donate \u00a3100,000 - a massive sum - provided that a Charter was granted within two years.\n\nThe Wills gift set off a chain reaction, and more money was raised within 24 hours than had been attracted during the previous three decades.\n\nNow things really started to move. After years of discussion, it was agreed that the Merchant Venturers' College and elements of the University College - formerly rivals - would merge to form a new Faculty of Engineering.\n\nFurthermore, the City Council offered the proceeds of a penny rate (some \u00a37,000 a year), subject to a Charter being obtained. Best of all, when a petition for a Charter was submitted to the Privy Council, it met with royal favour.\n\nOn 24 May 1909, 33 years after University College opened, the Charter, approved by King Edward VII, came into effect.\n\nIt was a day of celebration across Bristol."
