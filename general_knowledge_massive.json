        "content": "Fees\n\nIt's a good idea to think about funding your postgraduate degree as soon as possible. We can help you understand the costs and take control of your finances.\n\nThe two main costs you will face as a postgraduate student are tuition fees and living expenses. The tuition fee includes charges for tuition, examination and registration. It also includes a contribution towards the cost of membership of the\n\nStudents' Union\n\n.\n\nTuition fees\n\nEach postgraduate programme has a specific cost for tuition. Tuition fees are listed for\n\neach programme entry\n\nwherever possible.\n\nFees are quoted per year and are liable to rise each year. On an annual basis, the level of uplift to fees is considered by a group that consists of nominees of the University and student representatives, in consultation with the academic faculties.\n\nFees for new entrants: In deciding the annual level of increase for new starters, the University will consider a range of factors, including estimated inflation which has ranged from 4% to 8% in recent years, and the costs of delivering the programme. New entrants are advised to check\n\nthe programme pages\n\nfor confirmation of their fees, which will usually be published by October for the following academic year.\n\nFees for continuing students: Most fees will increase in line with the fees for new entrants. However, increases will be capped at a maximum of 8% per year (5% for students who started in the 2022/23 academic year or earlier). Confirmation of fees will be published on the webpages at the same time as per the fees for new entrants.\n\nFee status\n\nFees vary between programmes, and the amount you pay will depend on whether you are a UK or international student. If you are unsure which fees you should pay, read about how we determine your\n\nfee status\n\n.\n\nDeposits\n\nSome self-funded international students on taught postgraduate programmes will pay a deposit of \u00a32,000. You can\n\npay this online\n\n.\n\nIn some circumstances, you can apply for a deposit refund.\n\nRead our deposit refund policy\n\n.\n\nBench fees\n\nSome programmes charge a bench fee in addition to tuition fees. Bench fees are charged when a programme (or specific project) incurs extra costs, such as specialist laboratory or field work.

        "content": "Fees and funding\n\nStudying at university is one of the most significant investments you will make. The University will provide the support you need to take control of your finances.\n\nThe two main costs you will face as an undergraduate student are tuition fees and living expenses.\n\nFind out more about the\n\nfinancial\n\nhelp and support available.\n\nTuition fees\n\nFees are subject to annual review, so they may be liable to rise each year in line with UK government policy / inflation.\n\nHome students (UK, Channel Islands and Isle of Man)\n\nHome tuition fees for each degree course are listed in the\n\nonline course finder\n\n.\n\nCurrent UK government guidance suggests that future fees will be set at the rates below. Please note that new legislation is expected to be passed in early 2026, so these rates are subject to change and future years (2027/28 onwards) will be confirmed annually.\n\n2025/26: \u00a39,535 (confirmed)\n\n2026/27: \u00a39,790 (to be confirmed)\n\n2027/28: \u00a310,050 (to be confirmed)\n\n2028/29: \u00a39,757 (estimate)\n\nStudents starting in 2025 can expect to pay around \u00a329,375 for a three-year course.\n\nStudents starting in 2026 can expect to pay approximately \u00a329,597 for a three-year course.\n\nDetails will be updated as per latest government guidance.\n\nContact your local education department for further details about financing your studies and for advice on whether your island government offers any grants or awards:\n\nIsland of Jersey\n\nStates of Guernsey\n\nIsle of Man\n\nInternational students (including EU)\n\nIf you are an international student, your tuition fees will depend on the\n\ncourse you study\n\n.\n\nInternational fees are reviewed annually and will generally increase by inflation each year of study, capped at a maximum of 8%. This increase does not apply to clinical courses.\n\nIf you're unsure which fees you should pay, read about how we determine your\n\nfee status\n\n.\n\nTransferring students\n\nIf you are transferring to the University of Bristol from another institution, you will be charged the same fee as a new student, regardless of the year of the course you are joining.\n\nDeferred students\n\nStudents with deferred entry will be charged the fee for the year they start their studies.\n\nPart-time courses\n\nIf you are studying an undergraduate course part time, your tuition fee will normally be pro rata the full-time fee for the course.\n\nFoundation year courses\n\nStudents on the one-year Foundation in Arts and Social Sciences or the Foundation in Science, Engineering and Mathematics courses may be eligible for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan. Find out more about the\n\nfinancial support available for Foundation Year students.\n\nStudy abroad, work abroad and industrial placement fees\n\nIf you are spending time away from the University for a placement as part of your course, you will be charged a reduced tuition fee during the relevant academic year.\n\nFor example in 2020 home students on full-year study and work abroad or industrial placements were charged 15 per cent of the total tuition fee. International students on full-year study and work abroad placements were charged 50 per cent of the total fee and those on whole-year industrial placements were charged 25 per cent of the total fee.\n\nIf you undertake a placement for less than a full academic year, your tuition fee will not be affected.\n\nIntercalating students\n\nIf you are an incoming external intercalating student, you will be charged the same fee as a new student.\n\nIf you are an existing University of Bristol student intercalating onto a different course within the University, find out more about\n\nIntercalated degree course fees\n\n.\n\nUniversity of Bristol students intercalating at Bristol or at a different university will be treated as continuing students on their return and therefore charged at the same continuing rate.\n\nPaying your fees\n\nYou don't need to pay your tuition fees until after you are registered at the University. Find out\n\nhow and when you can pay your tuition fees\n\n.\n\nFees for resits\n\nWe\n\nwill not\n\ncharge an extra tuition fee if you:\n\ncomplete resits or supplementary assessments in the same year of study that you take the unit.\n\ntake a supplementary year during which you engage with the content of unit(s) from home and only attend the university for assessment.\n\ntake extra unit(s) in a year of study to meet the requirements of conditional progression.\n\nWe\n\nwill\n\ncharge a tuition fee if you:\n\ntake a supplementary or repeat year, during which you attend the university for teaching and assessment.\n\ntake extra unit(s) in a year, beyond those the university requires.\n\nThe fee will be a proportion of a standard fee, based on the credit point value of the unit(s) you study, in line with SLC guidance.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn undergraduate home student who started their course after August 2017 is charged a tuition fee of \u00a39,250 per year for a standard year of study.\n\nA standard year of study has a total value of 120 credit points.\n\nIf the student takes a supplementary year in which they attend the university to take three 20 credit point units, they study a total of 60 credit points in that year.\n\n60 credit points \u00f7 120 credit points = 0.5. This is the proportion of credits compared to a standard year.\n\n0.5 x \u00a39,250 = \u00a34,625. This is the amount the student would be charged for the supplementary year in this example.\n\nLiving expenses\n\nBudgeting and living expenses\n\ncover everything you will need to pay for, other than tuition fees. The amount you spend will depend upon your lifestyle choices.\n\nAs a guide, most students spend between \u00a39,000 and \u00a315,000 per year including accommodation.\n\nFinancial help and support\n\nIf you have the talent and ability to succeed at Bristol, concerns about funding your studies should not stop you from applying.\n\nThe University offers a comprehensive package of\n\nfinancial support\n\nto students from low-income backgrounds, in addition to the support provided by the UK government.\n\nThe following services are also available to help you manage your money:\n\nOur\n\nFees and Funding\n\nteam can provide you with information on bursaries and scholarships as well as advice on budgeting.\n\nThe\n\nCareers Service\n\ncan help you find suitable part-time or holiday work.\n\nOur Disability Services team can advise on funding to pay for specialist study support.\n\nSearch for funding\n\nUse our online search tool to see all University funding opportunities.",
